## Percona Monitoring and Management

A **single pane of glass** to easily view and monitor the performance of your MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and MariaDB databases.

[Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM)](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) is a best-of-breed open source database monitoring solution. It helps you reduce complexity, optimize performance, and improve the security of your business-critical database environments, no matter where they are located or deployed.
PMM helps users to:
* Reduce Complexity
* Optimize Database Performance
* Improve Data Security


See the [PMM Documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/index.html) for more information.

## Use Cases

* Monitor your database performance with customizable dashboards and real-time alerting.
* Spot critical performance issues faster, understand the root cause of incidents better and troubleshoot them more efficiently.
* Zoom-in, drill-down database performance from node to single query levels. Perform in-depth troubleshooting and performance optimization.
* Built-in Advisors run regular checks of the databases connected to PMM. The checks identify and alert you of potential security threats, performance degradation, data loss and data corruption.
* Backup and restore databases up to a specific moment with Point-in-Time-Recovery.

## Architecture

## Submitting Bug Reports

If you find a bug in Percona Monitoring and Management  or one of the related projects, you should submit a report to that project's [JIRA](https://jira.percona.com) issue tracker. Some of related project also have GitHub Issues enabled, so you also could submit there.

Your first step should be [to search](https://jira.percona.com/issues/?jql=project=PMM) the existing set of open tickets for a similar report. If you find that someone else has already reported your problem, then you can upvote that report to increase its visibility.

If there is no existing report, submit a report following these steps:

1. [Sign in to Percona JIRA.](https://jira.percona.com/login.jsp) You will need to create an account if you do not have one.
2. [Go to the Create Issue screen and select the relevant project.](https://jira.percona.com/secure/CreateIssueDetails!init.jspa?pid=11600&issuetype=1&priority=3)
3. Fill in the fields of Summary, Description, Steps To Reproduce, and Affects Version to the best you can. If the bug corresponds to a crash, attach the stack trace from the logs.

An excellent resource is [Elika Etemad's article on filing good bug reports.](http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/style/talks/filing-good-bugs/).

As a general rule of thumb, please try to create bug reports that are:

- *Reproducible.* Include steps to reproduce the problem.
- *Specific.* Include as much detail as possible: which version, what environment, etc.
- *Unique.* Do not duplicate existing tickets.
