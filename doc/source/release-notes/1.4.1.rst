Percona announces the release of Percona Monitoring and Management
|release|. This release contains fixes of bugs detected since the release of
|prev-release|.

For install and upgrade instructions, see :ref:`deploy-pmm`.

Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :pmmbug:`1567`: The `btrfs`_ file system has been replaced with *XFS* in
  :ref:`AMI and OVF images <deploy-pmm.server.installing>` to meet the
  requirements of `AWS Marketplace`_.
* :pmmbug:`1594`: In |metrics-monitor|, the |graph.prometheus| dashboard has
  been updated to show more information about the running |prometheus|
  jobs and help estimate their efficiency.

Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :pmmbug:`1634`: In |metrics-monitor|, the configured
  |opt.external-metrics| monitoring services showed no data on the
  |graph.advanced-data-exploration| dashboard while custom |grafana| dashboards
  were producing the expected information.
* :pmmbug:`1636`: It was not possible to remove an |opt.external-metrics|
  monitoring service by using the |pmm-admin.remove| command if its name
  contained punctuation characters or whitespace.
* :pmmbug:`1620`: |pmm| could not be :ref:`upgraded <deploy-pmm.updating>` to
  version |prev-release| by using the :guilabel:`Update` button on the landing page.
