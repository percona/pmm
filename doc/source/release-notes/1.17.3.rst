:Date: January XX, 2020

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

PMM 1.17.3 release provides fixes for the regular expressions cross-site
scripting vulnerability in the ``serialize-javascript`` package
(CVE-2019-16769). Please note PMM versions were not affected by this
vulnerability, as serialize-javascript package is used as a build dependency
only.

Fixed Bugs
================================================================================

* :pmmbug:`5089`: The serialize-javascript package was updated to version 2.1.1
  because of the possibility of regular expressions cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-16769)
* :pmmbug:`4789`: the "Metrics" and "Query's first seen" text labels were
  partially overlapping in the Query Analytics dashboard
