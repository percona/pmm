  because of the Prototype Pollution vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-19919), and
  the serialize-javascript package was updated to version 2.1.1

  vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-16769)
* :pmmbug:`4923`: Textfile collector was not working after the upgrade from
  older versions on CentOS 7, producing a lot of errors in the log, due to the
