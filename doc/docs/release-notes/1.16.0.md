# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.16.0

* **Date**

    November 1, 2018


*PMM* ([Percona Monitoring and Management](../index.md)) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, and *PostgreSQL* performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for *MySQL* and *MongoDB* servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

This release offers three new features for both the Community and Percona Customers:

* Agentless PMM support - Use PMM Server to gather Database Metrics and Queries from remote instances with no PMM Client installed!
* Query Analytics + Metric Series – See Related Database activity alongside queries
* Simplify metrics collections

We addressed 11 new features and improvements, and fixed 21 bugs.

## Agentless PMM support for MySQL and PostgreSQL

You’re now able to connect *PMM Server* to your *MySQL* and *PostgreSQL* instances, whether they run in a cloud DBaaS environment, or under Operating Systems which are not natively supported by *PMM* (e.g. Windows), or when you do not have shell access to the server. This can help you get up and running with *PMM* using minimal configuration and zero client installation, however be aware there are limitations - *there won’t be any host-level dashboards populated for these nodes* since we don’t attempt to connect to the provider’s API nor are we granted access to the instance in order to deploy an exporter.

### How to use

You’ll be able to collect Metrics and Queries from *MySQL*, and Metrics from *PostgreSQL*.  You can add remote instances by selecting the *PMM Add Instance* item in a PMM Dropdown group of the system menu:

where you will then have the opportunity to add a Remote MySQL or Remote
PostgreSQL instance:

You’ll add the instance by supplying just the Hostname, database Username and
Password (and optional Port and Name):

Also new as part of this release is the ability to display nodes you’ve added,
on screen **RDS and Remote Instances**:

### Server activity metrics in the PMM Query Analytics dashboard

The Query Analytics dashboard now shows host and database activity graphs linked to the queries listed in a summary table.  This brings a view of System Activity (CPU, Disk, and Network) and Database Server Activity (Connections, Queries per Second, and Threads Running) to help you better pinpoint query pileups and other bottlenecks.

### Extending metrics with node_exporter textfile collector

While *PMM* provides an excellent solution for system monitoring, sometimes you may have the need for a metric that’s not present in the list of `node_exporter` metrics out of the box. There is a simple method to extend the list of available metrics without modifying the `node_exporter` code. It is based on the textfile collector.  We’ve enabled this collector as on by default, and it is deployed as part of `linux:metrics` in *PMM Client*.

The default directory for reading text files with the metrics is `/usr/local/percona/pmm-client/textfile-collector`, and the exporter reads files from it with the `.prom` extension. By default it contains an example file  `example.prom` which has commented contents and can be used as a template.

You are responsible for running a cronjob or other regular process to generate the metric series data and write it to this directory.

#### Example – collecting docker container information

This example will show you how to collect the number of running and stopped docker containers on a host. It uses a `crontab` task, set with the following lines in the cron configuration file (e.g. in `/etc/crontab`):

```
*/1 * * * *     root   echo -n "" > /tmp/docker_all.prom; docker ps -a -q | wc -l | xargs echo node_docker_containers_total >> /usr/local/percona/pmm-client/docker_all.prom;
*/1 * * * *     root   echo -n "" > /tmp/docker_running.prom; docker ps | wc -l | xargs echo node_docker_containers_running_total >> /usr/local/percona/pmm-client/docker_running.prom;
```

The result of the commands is placed into the `docker_all.prom` and `docker_running.prom` files and read by exporter and will create two new metric series named `node_docker_containers_total` and `node_docker_containers_running_total`, which we’ll then plot on a graph:
