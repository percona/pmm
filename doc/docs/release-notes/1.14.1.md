# Percona Monitoring and Management 1.14.1


* **Date**

    September 7, 2018


*PMM* ([Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html)) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL* and *MongoDB* performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for *MySQL* and *MongoDB* servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

We're releasing hotfix 1.14.1 to address three issues found post-release of
1.14.0:


* [PMM-2963](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-2963) - Upgrading to PMM 1.14.0 fails due to attempt to create already
existing Dashboard


    * Our upgrade script incorrectly tried to create dashboards that already
existed, and generating failure message:

```
A folder or dashboard in the general folder with the same name already exists
```


* [PMM-2958](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-2958) - Grafana did not update to 5.1 when upgrading from versions
older than 1.11


    * We identified a niche case where PMM installations that were upgraded from
< 1.11 would fail to upgrade Grafana to correct release 5.1 (Users were
left on Grafana 5.0)
