# *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.9.1

* **Date**

    April 12, 2018

This release contains bug fixes only and supersedes *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.9.0. This release effectively solves the problem in QAN when the *Count* column actually displayed the number of queries per minute, not per second, as the user would expect. The following screenshot demonstrates the problem. The value of the *Count* column for the **TOTAL** row is **649.38** *QPS* (queries per second). The total number **38.96 k** (38960) is only sixty times greater than the reported value of QPS. Thus, queries were counted for each minute within the selected time range of `Last 1 hour`.

The corrected version of QAN in PMM 1.9.1 shows that queries are now counted per second. The total number of queries is **60** \* **60** greater than the value of *QPS*, as should be expected for the chosen time range.
