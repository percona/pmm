# *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.7.0

* **Date**

    January 31, 2018

Percona announces the release of *Percona Monitoring and Management* 1.7.0.  *PMM* (Percona Monitoring and Management) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring *MySQL* and *MongoDB* performance.  You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for *MySQL* and *MongoDB* servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible..

This release features improved support for external services, which enables a PMM Server to store and display metrics for any available Prometheus exporter. For example, you could deploy the postgres_exporter and use PMM external services feature to store PostgreSQL metrics in PMM.  Immediately, you will see these new metrics in the *Advanced Data Exploration* dashboard. Then you could leverage many of the pre-developed PostgreSQL dashboards available on Grafana.com, and with a minimal amount of edits have a working PostgreSQL dashboard in PMM!  Watch for an upcoming blog post to demonstrate a walk-through of this unlocked functionality.

## New Features

* [PMM-1949](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1949): New dashboard: *MySQL Amazon Aurora Metrics*.

## Improvements

* [PMM-1712](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1712): Improve external exporters to let you easily add data monitoring from an arbitrary Prometheus exporter you have running on your host.
* [PMM-1510](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1510): Rename *swap in* and *swap out* labels to be more specific and help clearly see the direction of data flow for *Swap In* and *Swap Out*. The new labels are *Swap In (Reads)* and *Swap Out (Writes)* accordingly.
* [PMM-1966](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1966): Remove Grafana from list of exporters on dashboard to eliminate confusion with existing Grafana in the list of exporters on the current version of the dashboard.
* [PMM-1974](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1974): Add the *mongodb_up* in the Exporter Status dashboard. The new graph is added to maintain consistency of information about exporters. This is done based on new metrics implemented in [PMM-1586](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1586).

## Bug fixes

* [PMM-1967](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1967): Inconsistent formulas in Prometheus dashboards.
* [PMM-1986](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1986): Signing out with HTTP auth enabled leaves the browser *signed in*.
