# Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) management daemon

**pmm-managed** manages the configuration of [PMM](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html)
server components (VictoriaMetrics, Grafana, QAN, etc.) and exposes APIs for interacting with them. Those APIs are also used by
[pmm-admin tool](https://github.com/percona/pmm/tree/main/admin).
