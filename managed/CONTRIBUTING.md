# Contributing notes

pmm-managed is highly integrated with PMM Server environment. As a result, development and testing is done partially inside PMM Server container which we call "devcontainer". You can take a look at the architecture [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/architecture.html)


# Devcontainer setup

Install Docker and Docker Compose.

Checkout `main` branch which is the main branch for PMM 2.x development.

Run `make` to see a list of targets that can be run on host:
```
$ make
Please use `make <target>` where <target> is one of:
  env-up                    Start devcontainer.
  env-down                  Stop devcontainer.
  env                       Run `make TARGET` in devcontainer (`make env TARGET=help`); TARGET defaults to bash.
  release                   Build pmm-managed release binaries.
  help                      Display this help message.
```

`make env-up` starts devcontainer with all tools and mounts source code from the host. You can change code with your editor/IDE of choice as usual, or run editor inside devcontainer (see below for some special support of VSCode). To run make targets inside devcontainer use `make env TARGET=target-name`. For example:
```
$ make env TARGET=help
docker exec -it --workdir=/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed pmm-managed-server make help
Please use `make <target>` where <target> is one of:
  gen                       Generate files.
  install                   Install pmm-managed binary.
  install-race              Install pmm-managed binary with race detector.
  test                      Run tests.
...
```
Run run tests, use `make env TARGET=test`, etc.

Alternatively, it is possible to run `make env` to get inside devcontainer and run make targets as usual:
```
$ make env
docker exec -it --workdir=/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed pmm-managed-server make _bash
/bin/bash
[root@pmm-managed-server pmm-managed]# make test
make[1]: Entering directory `/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed'
go test -timeout=30s -p 1 ./...
...
```

`run` and `run-race` targets replace `/usr/sbin/pmm-managed` and restart pmm-managed with `supervisorctl`. As a result, it will use normal filesystem locations (`/etc/victoriametrics-promscrape.yml`, `/etc/supervisord.d`, etc.) and `pmm-managed` PostgreSQL database. Other locations (inside `testdata`) and `pmm-managed-dev` database are used for unit tests.

## Add instances for monitoring
`make env-up` just starts the PMM server but it doesn't setup anything to be monitored. We can use [pmm-admin](https://github.com/percona/pmm-admin) and [pmm-agent](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent) to add instances to be monitored to pmm-managed.

* Clone the pmm-admin [repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm-admin/) and install it by running `make install`.
* Clone the pmm-agent [repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent).
* Run database instances to be monitored, you can either run your own or use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file provided by pmm-agent to run MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB containers using `make env-up` in the pmm-agent repo (make sure to comment out the `pmm-server` service in the docker-compose file since we are already running pmm-managed in devcontainer).
* Open another shell session and `cd` into the pmm-agent repo, run `make setup-dev` and `make run` to setup and run pmm-agent and connect it to pmm-managed
* In another shell use pmm-admin to add agents to the database instances and start monitoring them using `pmm-admin add mysql --username=root --password=root-password`, `pmm-admin add postgresql --username=pmm-agent --password=pmm-agent-password` and `pmm-admin add mongodb --username=root --password=root-password`.
* Now pmm-managed has started monitoring the databases, login to the web client in your browser to verify. The number of monitored instances will have increased.

## Working with STT

* Setup the devcontainer using `make env-up` and run your changes inside it by running `make env` and then`make run`.
* Follow the steps in the [Add Instances for Monitoring](#add-instances-for-monitoring) to set up instances for monitoring.
* Go to the PMM dashboard and enable STT in `PMM -> PMM Settings -> Advanced Settings` which will make managed download STT checks from Percona Platform and execute them.
* Any failed STT checks will produce check results on the dashboard.

## Working with Integrated Alerting

Please go through the Integrated Alerting section in our [user documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/using/alerting.html).

# Internals

There are three makefiles: `Makefile` (host), `Makefile.devcontainer`, and `Makefile.include` (included in both). `Makefile.devcontainer` is mounted on top of `Makefile` inside devcontainer (see `docker-compose.yml`) to enable `make env TARGET=target-name` usage.

Devcontainer initialization code is located in `.devcontainer/setup.py`. It uses multiprocessing to run several commands in parallel to speed-up setup.

## Code Structure
```
.
├── bin - binaries
├── cmd - code for any scripts run by managed
├── data - integrated alerting templates and generated code
├── models - database helpers and types, the database schema can be found in models/database.go file
├── services - contains all the APIs for interacting with services like alertmanager, checks service, victoriametrics, etc
├── testdata - dummy data files used in unit tests
├── utils - utilities
```

# How to make PR
* If the changes require multiple PRs spanning multiple repos make sure to keep the branch names same.
* If the PR requires any API changes then make your changes in `main` branch of the [API repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm) and pull those changes in your pmm-managed branch by mentioning the API changes branch name in the `Gopkg.toml` constraint and running `dep ensure -v -update github.com/percona/pmm`.
* If the PR introduces changes to the IA templates make sure to run `make gen` to udpate the generated code.
* If the PR changes any files named `deps.go` make sure to run `make gen` to generate mock clients.
Before making PR, please run these commands locally:
* `make env TARGET=check-all` to run all checkers and linters.
* `make env TARGET=test-race` to run tests.
* For help, please post on the [PMM 2.x Forums](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-v2/)

## VSCode

VSCode provides first-class support for devcontainers. See:
