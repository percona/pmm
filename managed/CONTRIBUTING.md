# Contributing notes

**pmm-managed** is a core component of PMM Server. As such, its development and testing is best done inside of a PMM Server container, which we call "devcontainer". You can take a look at PMM's architecture [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/architecture.html)

# Devcontainer setup

Install Docker and Docker Compose.

Checkout `main` branch which is the main branch for PMM 2.x development.

Run `make` to see a list of targets that can be run on host:

```
$ make
Please use `make <target>` where <target> is one of:
  env-up                    Start devcontainer.
  env-down                  Stop devcontainer.
  env                       Run `make TARGET` in devcontainer (`make env TARGET=help`); TARGET defaults to bash.
  release                   Build pmm-managed release binaries.
  help                      Display this help message.
```

`make env-up` starts a devcontainer with all tools and mounts the source code from the host. You can write code using your IDE of choice as usual, or run an editor inside the devcontainer (see below how you can leverage VSCode). To run make targets inside the devcontainer, use `make env TARGET=target-name`. For example:

```
$ make env TARGET=help
docker exec -it --workdir=/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed pmm-server make help
Please use `make <target>` where <target> is one of:
  gen                       Generate files.
  install                   Install pmm-managed binary.
  install-race              Install pmm-managed binary with race detector.
  test                      Run tests.
...
```

To run tests, use `make env TARGET=test`, etc.

Alternatively, it is possible to run `make env` to get inside the devcontainer and run make targets as usual:

```
$ make env
docker exec -it --workdir=/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed pmm-server make _bash
/bin/bash
[root@pmm-server pmm-managed]# make test
make[1]: Entering directory `/root/go/src/github.com/percona/pmm-managed'
go test -timeout=30s -p 1 ./...
...
```

`run-managed` target replaces `/usr/sbin/pmm-managed` and restarts pmm-managed with `supervisorctl`. As a result, it will use regular filesystem locations (`/etc/victoriametrics-promscrape.yml`, `/etc/supervisord.d`, etc.) and `pmm-managed` PostgreSQL database. Other locations (inside `testdata`) and `pmm-managed-dev` database are used for unit tests.

## Add instances for monitoring

`make env-up` just starts the PMM server but it doesn't setup anything to be monitored. We can use [pmm-admin](https://github.com/percona/pmm-admin) and [pmm-agent](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent) to add instances to be monitored to pmm-managed.

- Clone the pmm-admin [repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm-admin/) and install it by running `make install`.
- Clone the pmm-agent [repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent).
- Run database instances to be monitored, you can either run your own or use the [`docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/percona/pmm-agent/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) file provided by pmm-agent to run MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB containers using `make env-up` in the pmm-agent repo (make sure to comment out the `pmm-server` service in the docker-compose file since we are already running pmm-managed in devcontainer).
- Open another shell session and `cd` into the pmm-agent repo, run `make setup-dev` and `make run` to setup and run pmm-agent and connect it to pmm-managed
- In another shell use pmm-admin to add agents to the database instances and start monitoring them using `pmm-admin add mysql --username=root --password=root-password`, `pmm-admin add postgresql --username=pmm-agent --password=pmm-agent-password` and `pmm-admin add mongodb --username=root --password=root-password`.
- Now pmm-managed has started monitoring the databases, login to the web client in your browser to verify. The number of monitored instances will have increased.

## Working with Advisors

- Setup the devcontainer using `make env-up` and run your changes inside by running `make env` and then `make run`.
- Follow the steps described in [Add Instances for Monitoring](#add-instances-for-monitoring) to set up instances for monitoring.
- Go to the PMM dashboard and enable Advisors in `PMM -> PMM Settings -> Advanced Settings` which will make managed download Advisor checks from Percona Platform and execute them.
- Any failed Advisor checks will produce check results on the dashboard.

## Working with Percona Alerting

Please go through the Percona Alerting section in our [user documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/get-started/alerting.html).

# Internals

There are three makefiles: `Makefile` (host), `Makefile.devcontainer`, and `Makefile.include`. `Makefile.devcontainer` is mounted on top of `Makefile` inside devcontainer (see `docker-compose.yml`) to enable `make env TARGET=target-name` usage.

Devcontainer initialization code is located in `.devcontainer/setup.py`. It uses multiprocessing to run several commands in parallel to speed-up the setup.

## Code Structure

```
.
├── bin - binaries
├── cmd - code for any scripts run by managed
├── data - alerting templates and generated code
├── models - database helpers and types, the database schema can be found in models/database.go file
├── services - contains all the APIs for interacting with services like checks service, victoriametrics, etc
├── testdata - dummy data files used in unit tests
├── utils - utilities
```

# How to make PR

- If the changes require multiple PRs spanning multiple repos make sure to keep the branch names same.
- If the PR requires any API changes then make your changes in `main` branch of the [API repo](https://github.com/percona/pmm) and pull those changes in your pmm-managed branch by mentioning the API changes branch name in the `Gopkg.toml` constraint and running `dep ensure -v -update github.com/percona/pmm`.
- If the PR changes any files named `deps.go` make sure to run `make gen` to generate mock clients.
  Before making PR, please run these commands locally:
- `make env TARGET=check-all` to run all checkers and linters.
- `make env TARGET=test-race` to run tests.
- For help, please post on the [PMM 2.x Forums](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-v2/)

## VSCode

VSCode provides first-class support for devcontainers. See:
