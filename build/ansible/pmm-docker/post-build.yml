    # This step is required because of a change between VictoriaMetrics 1.77.1 and 1.82.1.
    # VictoriaMetrics tries to atomically rename directories in this folder on startup.
    # With RedHat-based docker images the rename fails with an error "Invalid cross-device link".
    # This is due to the way OverlayFS and kernel works. More info https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25409
    # This step ensures the directory is empty on startup and the contents are recreated.
    # This is not an issue if the folder is in a volume or mounted from the host OS.
