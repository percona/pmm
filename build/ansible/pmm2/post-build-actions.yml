    # This step is required because of a change between VictoriaMetrics 1.77.1 and 1.82.1.
    # VictoriaMetrics tries to atomically rename directories in this folder on startup.
    # With RedHat-based docker images the rename fails with an error "Invalid cross-device link".
    # This due to the way OverlayFS and kernel works. More info https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/25409
