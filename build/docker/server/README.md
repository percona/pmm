# PMM Server

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database observability, monitoring, and management tool for MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB and ProxySQL, and their servers. With PMM, you can identify critical performance issues faster, understand the root cause of incidents better, and troubleshoot them more efficiently.

- The tool allows you to view node to single query performance metrics and explain plans for all of your databases in a single place.
- With Query Analytics, you can quickly locate costly and slow running queries and drill into precise execution details to address bottlenecks.
- Percona Advisors equip you with performance, security and configuration recommendations that help you keep your databases performing at their best.
- Alerting and management features like backup and restore are designed to increase the velocity of your IT team.

## Starting PMM Server

```
docker pull percona/pmm-server:3
docker volume create pmm-data
docker run --detach --restart always --publish 443:8443 -v pmm-data:/srv --name pmm-server percona/pmm-server:3
```

Point your browser to https://hostname:443

This example uses the tag `:3` to pull the latest PMM 3.x version, but other, [more specific tags](https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server/tags), are also available.
