================================================================================

The |dbd.compare-system-parameters| dashboard allows to compare wide range of
parameters of the servers monitored by |PMM|. Same type parameters are shown
side by side for all the servers, grouped in the following sections:

- System Information
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk Partitions
- Disk Performance
- Network

The *System Information* section shows the *System Info* summary of each
server, as well as *System Uptime*, *CPU Cores*, *RAM*, *Saturation Metrics*,
and *Load Average* gauges.

The *CPU* section offers the *CPU Usage*, *Interrupts*, and *Context Switches*
metrics.

In the *Memory* section, you can find the *Memory Usage*, *Swap Usage*, and
*Swap Activity* metrics.

The *Disk Partitions* section encapsulates two metrics, *Mountpoint Usage* and
*Free Space*.

The *Disk Performance* section contains the *I/O Activity*, *Disk Operations*,
*Disk Bandwidth*, *Disk IO Utilization*, *Disk Latency*, and *Disk Load*
metrics.

Finally, *Network* section shows *Network Traffic*, and *Network Utilization
Hourly* metrics.
