Adding a MySQL or PostgreSQL Remote DB instance to |pmm|
********************************************************************************

There is a quick method for users to add DBaaS instances to |pmm| without having
to hook into the Cloud Provider's API, and with no need to have |pmm-client|
installed or any exporters running on the monitored node. The drawback of this
approach is that you will not have visibility of host-level metrics (CPU,
memory, and disk activity will not be captured nor displayed in |pmm|). 

.. note: There is an alternative and more complex approach available for
         |mysql-server|, which involves API-aware addition of an Amazon RDS /
         Aurora DB instance.

Both methods can be accessed in the |metrics-monitor| navigation menu by
selecting the |pmm-add-instance| item in a |gui.pmm-dropdown| group:

Two database servers are currently supported by this method: |postgresql| and
|mysql|.

Adding a Remote PostgreSQL Instance
================================================================================

To add a remote PostgreSQL DB instance, you will need to fill in three fields:
Hostname, Username, and Password, and optionally override the default Port and Name fields:

Adding a Remote MySQL Instance
================================================================================

To add a remote MySQL DB instance, you will need to fill in three fields:
Hostname, Username, and Password, and optionally override the default Port and Name fields:

Viewing Remote MySQL and PostgreSQL Instances
================================================================================

|amazon-rds| and remote instances can be seen in the RDS and
Remote Instances list, which can be accessed in the |metrics-monitor| navigation
menu by selecting the *PMM RDS and Remote Instances* item from the
|gui.pmm-dropdown| menu:

Remote ones have `remote` keyword as a Region:
