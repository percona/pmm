.. _dashboard.network-overview.icmp:

ICMP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section has the following metrics:

- Echos
- Timestamps/Mask Requests

.. rubric:: ICMP Errors

InErrors
   Messages which the entity received but determined as having ICMP-specific
   errors (bad ICMP checksums, bad length, etc.)
OutErrors
   Messages which this entity did not send due to problems discovered within
   ICMP, such as a lack of buffers
InDestUnreachs
   Destination Unreachable messages received
OutDestUnreachs
   Destination Unreachable messages sent
InType3
   Destination unreachable
OutType3
   Destination unreachable
InCsumErrors
   Messages with ICMP checksum errors
InTimeExcds
   Time Exceeded messages received

.. rubric:: Messages/Redirects

InMsgs
   Messages which the entity received. Note that this counter includes all those
   counted by icmpInErrors
InRedirects
   Redirect messages received
OutMsgs
   Messages which this entity attempted to send. Note that this counter includes
   all those counted by icmpOutErrors
OutRedirects
   Redirect messages sent. For a host, this object will always be zero, since
   hosts do not send redirects

.. rubric:: Echos

InEchoReps
   Echo Reply messages received
InEchos
   Echo (request) messages received
OutEchoReps
   Echo Reply messages sent
OutEchos
   Echo (request) messages sent	    

.. rubric:: Timestamps/Mask Requests

OutAddrMaskReps
   Address Mask Reply messages sent
OutAddrMasks
   Address Mask Request messages sent
InTimestampReps
   Timestamp Reply messages received
InTimestamps
   Timestamp Request messages received
OutTimestampReps
   Timestamp Reply messages sent
OutTimestamps
   Timestamp Request messages sent
