|prometheus| Exporters Summary
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section provides a summary of how exporters are used across the selected
hosts. It includes the average usage of CPU and memory as well as the number of
hosts being monitored and the total number of running exporters.

.. rubric:: Metrics in this section

- **Avg CPU Usage per Host** shows the average CPU usage in percent per host for
  all exporters.
- **Avg Memory Usage per Host** shows the Exporters average Memory usage per
  host.
- **Monitored Hosts** shows the number of monitored hosts that are running
  Exporters.
- **Exporters Running** shows the total number of Exporters running with this
  PMM Server instance.

.. note::

   The CPU usage and memory usage do not include the additional CPU and memory
   usage required to produce metrics by the application or operating system.

.. _dashboard.prometheus-exporters-overview.resource-usage-by-host:

|prometheus| Exporters Resource Usage by Host
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section shows how resources, such as |cpu| and memory, are being used by the
exporters for the selected hosts.

.. rubric:: Metrics in this section

- **CPU Usage** plots the Exporters' CPU usage across each monitored host (by
  default, All hosts).
- **Memory Usage** plots the Exporters' Memory usage across each monitored host
  (by default, All hosts).

.. _dashboard.prometheus-exporters-overview.resource-usage-by-type:

|prometheus| Exporters Resource Usage by Type
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section shows how resources, such as |cpu| and memory, are being used by the
exporters for host types: |mysql|, |mongodb|, |proxysql|, and the system.

.. rubric:: Metrics in this section

- **CPU Cores Used** shows the Exporters' CPU Cores used for each type of
  Exporter. 
- **Memory Usage** shows the Exporters' memory used for each type of Exporter.

.. _dashboard.prometheus-exporters-overview.hosts:

List of Hosts
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

At the bottom, this dashboard shows details for each running host. 

- **CPU Used** show the CPU usage as a percentage for all Exporters.
- **Mem Used** shows total Memory Used by Exporters.
- **Exporters Running** shows the number of Exporters running.
- **RAM** shows the total amount of RAM of the host.
- **Virtual CPUs** shows the total number of virtual CPUs on the host.

You can click the value of the |gui.cpu-used|, |gui.memory-used|, or
|gui.exporters-running| column to open the
:ref:`dashboard.prometheus-exporter-status` for further analysis.
