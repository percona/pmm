Load Average
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or
uninterruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or
waiting to use the CPU.  A process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some
I/O access, eg waiting for disk.

This metric is best used for trends. If you notice the load average rising, it
may be due to innefficient queries. In that case, you may further analyze your
queries in :ref:`QAN <QAN>`.

server. This variable includes statements executed within stored programs,
