Restoring the Backed Up Information to the PMM Data Container
================================================================================

If you have a backup copy of your |opt.pmm-data| container, you can restore it
into a |docker| container. Start with renaming the existing |pmm| containers to
prevent data loss, create a new |opt.pmm-data| container, and finally copy the
backed up information into the |opt.pmm-data| container.

|tip.run-all.root|

#. Stop the running |opt.pmm-server| container.

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.stop.pmm-server.txt

#. Rename the |opt.pmm-server| container to |opt.pmm-server-backup|.

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.rename.pmm-server.pmm-server-backup.txt

#. Rename the |opt.pmm-data| to |opt.pmm-data-backup|

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.rename.pmm-data.pmm-data-backup.txt

#. Create a new |opt.pmm-data| container

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.create.percona-pmm-server-latest.txt
   
.. important:: The last step creates a new |opt.pmm-data| container based on the
	       |opt.pmm-server.latest| image. If you do not intend to use the
	       |opt.latest| tag, specify the exact version instead, such as
	       **1.5.0**. You can find all available versions of
	       |opt.pmm-server| images at `percona/pmm-server`_.

Assuming that you have a backup copy of your |opt.pmm-data|, created according
to the procedure described in the:ref:`pmm.server.docker.backing-up` section,
restore your data as follows:

#. Change the working directory to the directory that contains your
   |opt.pmm-data| backup files.

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/cd.pmm-data-backup.txt

   .. note:: This example assumes that the backup directory is found in your
             home directory.
	     
#. Copy data from your backup directory to the |opt.pmm-data| container.

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.cp.txt
 
#. Apply correct ownership to |opt.pmm-data| files:

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.run.rm.it.chown.txt
 
#. Run (create and launch) a new |opt.pmm-server| container:

   .. include:: ../../.res/code/docker.run.latest.txt

To make sure that the new server is available run the |pmm-admin.check-network|
command from the computer where |pmm-client| is installed. |tip.run-this.root|.

.. include:: ../../.res/code/pmm-admin.check-network.txt
