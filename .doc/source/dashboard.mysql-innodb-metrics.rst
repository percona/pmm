|mysql| |innodb| Metrics
================================================================================

This dashboard contains metrics that help analyze how the |innodb| engine
performs.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-checkpoint-age:

InnoDB Checkpoint Age
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The maximum checkpoint age is determined by the total length of all transaction
log files (`innodb_log_file_size`).

When the checkpoint age reaches the maximum checkpoint age, blocks are flushed
syncronously. The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those
logs and let the checkpointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you
don't do this, InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time,
i.e. when you are busiest.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-transactions:

|innodb| Transactions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

|innodb| is an MVCC storage engine, which means you can start a transaction and
continue to see a consistent snapshot even as the data changes. This is
implemented by keeping old versions of rows as they are modified.

The *InnoDB History List* is the undo logs which are used to store these
modifications. They are a fundamental part of the |innodb| transactional
architecture.

If the history length is rising regularly, do not let open connections linger
for a long period as this can affect the performance of |innodb|
considerably. It is also a good idea to look for long running queries in |qan|.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-row-operations:

|innodb| Row Operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric allows you to see which operations occur and the number of rows
affected per operation. A metric like *Queries Per Second* will give you an idea
of queries, but one query could effect millions of rows.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-row-lock-time:

|innodb| Row Lock Time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When data is locked, then that means that another session cannot update that
data until the lock is released (which unlocks the data and allows other users
to update that data. Locks are usually released by either a |sql.rollback| or
|sql.commit| SQL statement.

|innodb| implements standard row-level locking where there are two types of
locks, shared (S) locks and exclusive (X) locks.

A shared (S) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to read a row.  An
exclusive (X) lock permits the transaction that holds the lock to update or
delete a row.  *Average Row Lock Wait Time* is the row lock wait time divided by
the number of row locks.

*Row Lock Waits* indicates how many times a transaction waited on a row lock per
second.

*Row Lock Wait Load* is a rolling *5* minute average of *Row Lock Waits*.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-io:

|innodb| I/O
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric has the following series:

- *Data Writes* is the total number of InnoDB data writes.
- *Data Reads* is the total number of InnoDB data reads (OS file reads).
- *Log Writes* is the number of physical writes to the InnoDB redo log file.
- *Data Fsyncs* is the number of fsync() operations. The frequency of fsync()
  calls is influenced by the setting of the innodb_flush_method configuration
  option.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-log-file-usage-hourly:

|innodb| Log File Usage Hourly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Along with the buffer pool size, `innodb_log_file_size` is the most important
setting when we are working with InnoDB. This graph shows how much data was
written to InnoDB's redo logs over each hour. When the InnoDB log files are
full, InnoDB needs to flush the modified pages from memory to disk.

The rules of the thumb is to keep one hour of traffic in those logs and let the
checkpointing perform its work as smooth as possible. If you don't do this,
InnoDB will do synchronous flushing at the worst possible time, ie when you are
busiest.

This graph can help guide you in setting the correct `innodb_log_file_size`.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.innodb-deadlocks:

|innodb| Deadlocks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A deadlock in |mysql| happens when two or more transactions mutually hold
and request for locks, creating a cycle of dependencies. In a transaction
system, deadlocks are a fact of life and not completely avoidable. InnoDB
automatically detects transaction deadlocks, rollbacks a transaction
immediately and returns an error.

.. _dashboard.mysql-innodb-metrics.condition-pushdown:

|innodb| Condition Pushdown
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Index Condition Pushdown (ICP) is an optimization for the case where |mysql|
retrieves rows from a table using an index.

Without ICP, the storage engine traverses the index to locate rows in the base
table and returns them to the |mysql| server which evaluates the ``WHERE``
condition for the rows. With ICP enabled, and if parts of the ``WHERE``
condition can be evaluated by using only columns from the index, the |mysql|
server pushes this part of the ``WHERE`` condition down to the storage engine.
The storage engine then evaluates the pushed index condition by using the index
entry and only if this is satisfied is the row read from the table.

ICP can reduce the number of times the storage engine must access the base table
and the number of times the |mysql| server must access the storage engine.
