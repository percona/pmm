IO Thread Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows if the IO Thread is runnig or not. It only applies to a slave
host.

.. include:: .res/contents/io-thread.what-is.txt

.. rubric:: Possible values

Yes

   The thread is running and is connected to a replication master

No

   The thread is not running because it is not lauched yet or because an error
   has occured connecting to the master host

Connecting

   The thread is running but is not connected to a replication master

No value

   The host is not configured to be a replication slave

IO Thread Running is one of the parameters that the command
|sql.show-slave-status| returns.

SQL Thread Running
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows if the SQL thread is running or not. It only applies to a
slave host.

.. include:: .res/contents/io-thread.what-is.txt
   
.. rubric:: Possibile values

Yes

   SQL Thread is running and is applying events from the realy log to the local
   slave host

No

   SQL Thread is not running because it is not launched yet or because of an
   errror occurred while applying an event to the local slave host

.. _dashboard.mysql-replication.replication-error-no:

Replication Error No
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows the number of the last error in the SQL Thread encountered
which caused replication to stop.

One of the more common errors is *Error: 1022 Duplicate Key Entry*. In such a
case replication is attempting to update a row that already exists on the slave.
The SQL Thread will stop replication in order to avoid data corruption.

.. _dashboard.mysql-replication.read-only:

Read only
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric indicates whether the host is configured to be in *Read Only*
mode or not.

.. rubric:: Possible values

Yes

   The slave host permits no client updates except from users who have the SUPER
   privilege or the REPLICATION SLAVE privilege.

   This kind of configuration is tipically used for slave hosts in a replication
   environment to avoid a user can inadvertently or voluntarily modify data
   causing inconsistencies and stopping the replication process.

No

   The slave host is not configured in *Read Only* mode.

.. _dashboard.mysql-replication.mysql-replication-delay:

MySQL Replication Delay
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows the number of seconds the slave host is delayed in replication
applying events compared to when the Master host applied them, denoted by the
``Seconds_Behind_Master`` value, and only applies to a slave host.

Since the replication process applies the data modifications on the slave
asyncronously, it could happen that the slave replicates events after some
time. The main reasons are:

- **Network round trip time** - high latency links will lead to non-zero
  replication lag values.
- **Single threaded nature of replication channels** - master servers have the
  advantage of applying changes in parallel, whereas slave ones are only able to
  apply changes in serial, thus limiting their throughput. In some cases Group
  Commit can help but is not always applicable.
- **High number of changed rows or computationally expensive SQL** - depending
  on the replication format (``ROW`` vs ``STATEMENT``), significant changes to
  the database through high volume of rows modified, or expensive CPU will all
  contribute to slave servers lagging behind the master.

Generally adding more CPU or Disk resources can alleviate replication lag
issues, up to a point.

Ideally a value of 0 is desired, but be aware that ``Seconds_Behind_Master`` is
an integer value and thus rounding is a factor. If you desire greater precision,
consider the Percona Toolkit tool ``pt-heartbeat``, as this graph will
automatically take into account this tool and then show you greater resolution
in the milliseconds.

.. _dashboard.mysql-replication.binlog-size:

Binlog Size
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows the overall size of the binary log files, which can exist on
both master and slave servers. The binary log (also known as the binlog)
contains events that describe database changes: ``CREATE TABLE``,
``ALTER TABLE``, updates, inserts, deletes and other statements or database
changes. The binlog is the file that is read by slaves via their IO Thread
process in order to replicate database changes modification on the data and on
the table structures. There can be more than one binlog file present depending
on the binlog rotation policy adopted (for example using the configuration
variables ``max_binlog_size`` and ``expire_logs_days``).

.. _dashboard.mysql-replication.relay-log-space:

Relay Log Space
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This metric shows the overall size of the relay log files. It only applies
to a slave host.

The relay log consists of a set of numbered files containing the events to be
executed on the slave host in order to replicate database changes.

The relay log has the same format as the binlog.

There can be multiple relay log files depending on the rotation policy adopted
(using the configuration variable |opt.max-relay-log-size|).

As soon as the SQL thread completes to execute all events in the relay log file,
the file is deleted.

If this metric contains a high value, the variable |opt.max-relay-log-file| is
high too. Generally, this not a serious issue. If the value of this metric is
constantly increased, the slave is delaying too much in applying the events.

Treat this metric in the same way as the
:ref:`dashboard.mysql-replication.mysql-replication-delay` metric.
