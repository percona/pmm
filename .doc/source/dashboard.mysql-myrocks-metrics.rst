|dbd.mysql-myrocks-metrics| Dashboard
================================================================================

The MyRocks_ storage engine developed by |facebook| based on the |rocksdb|
storage engine is applicable to systems which primarily interact with the
database by writing data to it rather than reading from it. |rocksdb| also
features a good level of compression, higher than that of the |innodb| storage
engine, which makes it especially valuable when optimizing the usage of hard
drives.

|pmm| collects statistics on the |myrocks| storage engine for |mysql| in the
|metrics-monitor| information for this dashboard comes from the
|inf-schema| tables.
