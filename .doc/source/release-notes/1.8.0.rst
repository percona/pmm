|pmm.name| |release|
================================================================================

:Date: February 27, 2018

|percona| announces the release of |pmm.name| |release|.  |info.pmm.about|.

This release introduces many improvements in the user interface and
optimizations of performance.

New landing page
================================================================================

The home page has been removed in favor of the *Home* dashboard to make the look
and feel of |pmm| web interface more consistent. The *Home* dashboard gives a
general overview of your system and provides links to useful resources. You can
immediately go to a dashboard of your choice either by using the conventional
*Dashboard Dropdown* at the top of the page or the new dashboard menu.

Improved dashboard menu layout
================================================================================

The new dashboard menu provides a convenient grouping of dashboards making the
switching between dashboards easy: select a group, such as |mysql| or *OS*, and
choose from a short list in the menu that opens. The new dashboard menu is
available from every dashboard in |pmm|.

Automatic Memory Configuration
================================================================================

This release also features improved memory usage on the host system in
|pmm-server|. By default, |pmm| now automatically scales its use with system
size rather than using static amount of memory, unless you explicitly set the
maximum value (by using the |opt.metrics-memory| in |docker|, for example).

New Features
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1145`: Move |percona| dashboards to |grafana| plugin. We have updated
  the |percona| dashboards to use the |grafana| plugin system in order to
  simplify upgrades.
- :pmmbug:`1470`: Implement a custom |prometheus| rds_exporter to collect
  |amazon-cloudwatch| metrics.  You can now explore |amazon-cloudwatch| metrics
  from |prometheus|, for example using the |dbd.advanced-data-exploration|
  dashboard. In prior versions we were using |amazon-cloudwatch| API calls
  directly.
- :pmmbug:`2046`: Configure memory consumption automatically for |pmm-server|.
  In this release we improved memory usage in |pmm-server|. By default, |pmm|
  now automatically scales its use with system size rather than using a static
  amount of memory. You can override this behaviour (for example, if you need to
  share resources with other containers) by using the |opt.metrics-memory|
  option in |docker|. You can use the old static size of memory by running:

  .. code-block:: bash

     $ docker ... -e METRICS_MEMORY=786432

Improvements
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1425`: Replace the Home page with the *Home* dashboard. The home page
  has been removed in favor of the *Home* dashboard to make the look and feel of
  |pmm| web interface more consistent. The *Home* dashboard gives a general
  overview of your system and provides links to useful resources. You can
  immediately go to a dashboard of your choice either by using the conventional
  *Dashboard Dropdown* at the top of the page or the new dashboard menu.
- :pmmbug:`1738`: Add the *Dashboard* menu to make the discovery of dashboards
  easier.
- :pmmbug:`1976`: Apply consistent rules for computing CPU metrics. We updated
  the query that generates CPU utilization for the |dbd.mysql-overview|, |dbd.summary|
  and |dbd.system-overview| dashboards as before we were being in-consistent in our
  determination of CPU.
- :pmmbug:`2007`: Squash new |docker| layers for a smaller total size
  We reduced the size of the |docker| container from ~475 MB to ~350 MB
- :pmmbug:`1711`: Add SQL and External Locks graphs to the
  |mysql-performance-schema| dashboard.  Added new graph to the
  |mysql-performance-schema| dashboard to show locks from perspective of count
  of events and from time.

- :pmmbug:`1763`: Update the forked |prometheus| exporter mysqld_exporter to the
  `latest upstream version <https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter>`_ to
  include recent bug fixes.
- :pmmbug:`2004`: Add the */ping* alias to nginx to enable a basic health check
  URL to the |pmm-server| API.
- :pmmbug:`1365`: Provide descriptions of all metrics in the
  |dbd.cross-server-graphs| dashboard. We have added metric descriptions in order to
  improve the understanding of the displayed metric series and to provide links
  to documentation and blog articles, beginning with the |dbd.cross-server-graphs|.
