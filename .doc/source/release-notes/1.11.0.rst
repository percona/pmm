.. _1.11.0:

================================================================================
Percona Monitoring and Management 1.11.0
================================================================================

:Date: May, 23 2018

For more information about this release, see the `release announcement`_.

In PMM Release 1.11.0, we\'re delivering the following changes:

- Configurable MySQL Slow Log Rotation - Enable or Disable rotation, and specify
  how many files to keep on disk
- Predictable Graphs - We\'ve updated our formulas to use aggregation functions
  over time for more reliable graphs
- MySQL Exporter Parsing of my.cnf - We\'ve improved how we read my.cnf
- Annotation improvements - Passing multiple strings results in single
  annotation being written

The issues in the release includes 1 new features & improvements, and 9 bugs fixed.

MySQL Slow Log Rotation Improvements
================================================================================

We spent some time this release going over how we handle MySQL\'s Slow Log
rotation logic. Query Analytics requires that slow logging be enabled (either to
file, or to PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA) and what we found was that Users of Percona
Server for MySQL overwhelmingly choose logging to a file in order to take
advantage of `log_slow_verbosity
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/diagnostics/slow_extended.html#log_slow_verbosity>`_
which provides `enhanced InnoDB Usage information
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/diagnostics/slow_extended.html#innodb-usage-information>`_.
The challenge however with MySQL\'s Slow Log is that it is very verbose and
thus the number one concern is disk space - PMM strives to Do No Harm and so
doing MySQL Slow Log Rotation was a natural fit, but until this release we were
very strict and hadn't enabled any configuration of these parameters.

Percona Server for MySQL Users have long known about `Slow Query Log Rotation <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/flexibility/slowlog_rotation.html>`_ and
Expiration, but until now had no way of using the in-built Percona Server
feature while ensuring that PMM wasn't missing any queries from the Slow Log
during file rotation. Or perhaps your use case is that you want to do Slow Log
Rotation using logrotate or some other facility. Today with Release 1.11 this is
now possible!

We have made two significant changes:

- You can now specify the number of Slow Log files to remain on disk, and let
  PMM handle deleting the oldest files first. **Default remains unchanged - 1 Slow Log to remain on disk**.
- Slow Log rotation can now be disabled, for example if you want to manage
  rotation using logrotate or Percona Server for MySQL Slow Query Log Rotation
  and Expiration. **Default remains unchanged - Slow Log Rotation is ON**.

You specify each of these two new controls when setting up the MySQL service. The following example specifies that 5 Slow Log files should remain on disk:

.. code-block:: bash
		
   $ pmm-admin add mysql ... --retain-slow-logs=5

While the following example specifies that Slow Log rotation is to be disabled
(flag value of false), with the assumption that you will perform your own Slow
Log Rotation:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pmm-admin add mysql ... --slow-log-rotation=false

We do not currently support modifying option parameters for an existing
service definition. This means you must remove, then re-add the service and
including the new options.

We are including a logrotate script in this post to get you started, and it
is designed to keep 30 copies of Slow Logs at 1GB each. Note that you will
need to update the Slow Log location, and ensure a MySQL User Account with
SUPER, RELOAD are used for this script to successfully execute.

.. rubric:: Example logrotate

.. code-block:: guess

   /var/mysql/mysql-slow.log {
		nocompress
		create 660 mysql mysql
		size 1G
		dateext
		missingok
		notifempty
		sharedscripts
		postrotate
		/bin/mysql -e 'SELECT @@global.long_query_time INTO @LQT_SAVE; SET GLOBAL long_query_time=2000; SELECT SLEEP(2); FLUSH SLOW LOGS; SELECT SLEEP(2); SET GLOBAL long_query_time=@LQT_SAVE;'
		endscript
		rotate 30
   }

Predictable Graphs
================================================================================

We\'ve updated the logic on 4 Dashboards to better handle predictability and
also zooming to look at shorter time ranges. For example, refreshing PXC/Galera
Graphs prior to 1.11 led to graphs spiking at different points during the metric
series. We\'ve reviewed each of these Graphs and their corresponding queries
and added in <aggregation>_over_time() functions so that Graphs display a
consistent view of the metric series. This also improves your ability to drill
in on the Dashboards, so that no matter how short your time range, you will
still observe the same spikes and troughs in your metric series. The four
Dashboards affected by this improvement are:

- Home Dashboard
- PXC/Galera Graphs Dashboard
- MySQL Overview Dashboard
- MySQL InnoDB Metrics Dashboard
- MySQL Exporter Parsing of my.cnf

In earlier releases, the MySQL Exporter expected only key=value type flags and
would ignore options without values (i.e. disable-auto-rehash), and could
sometimes read the wrong section of the my.cnf file. We\'ve updated the parsing
engine to be more MySQL compatible.

Annotation Improvements
================================================================================

Annotations permit the display of an event on all dashboards in PMM. Users
reported that passing more than one string to ``pmm-admin`` annotate would generate
an error, so we updated the parsing logic to assume all strings passed during
Annotation creation generates a single Annotation event. Previously you needed
to enclose your strings in quotes so that it would be parsed as a single string.
