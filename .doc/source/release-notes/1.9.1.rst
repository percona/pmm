|tip.bug-fix-release| |pmm.name| |prev-release|. This release
effectively solves the problem in |qan| when the |gui.count| column
actually displayed the number of queries per minute, not per second,
as the user would expect. The following screenshot demonstrates the
problem. The value of the |gui.count| column for the **TOTAL** row is
**649.38** *QPS* (queries per second). The total number **38.96
k** (38960) is only sixty times greater than the reported value of
QPS. Thus, queries were counted for each minute within the selected
time range of :option:`Last 1 hour`.

The corrected version of |qan| in |pmm| |release| shows that queries
are now counted per second. The total number of queries is **60** *
**60** greater than the value of *QPS*, as should be expected for the
chosen time range.
