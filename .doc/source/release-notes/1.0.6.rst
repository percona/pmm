      --volumes-from pmm-data \
      --name pmm-server \
      --restart always \

#. :ref:`Install new PMM Client version <deploy-pmm.client.installing>`
   on all hosts that you are monitoring.

      sudo yum update pmm-client

Changes
=======

**New in PMM Server:**

* Prometheus 1.2.2

* Made external static files local for PMM home page

* Metrics Monitor improvements:

  * Added *Amazon RDS OS Metrics* dashboard and CloudWatch data source.

  * Added the PMM Server host to metrics monitoring.

  * Refactored MongoDB dashboards.

  * Added *File Descriptors* graph to **System Overview** dashboard.

  * Added *Mountpoint Usage* graph to **Disk Space** dashboard.

* Query Analytics improvements:

  * QAN data is now purged correctly.

  * QAN data retention is made configurable
    with ``QUERIES_RETENTION`` option.
    Default is 8 days.

* Various small fixes to Query Analytics.

**New in PMM Client:**

* Fixes for ``mysql:queries`` service using Performance Schema as query source:

  * Fixed crash when ``DIGEST_TEXT`` is ``NULL``.

  * Removed iteration over all query digests on startup.

  * Added sending of query examples to QAN if available
    (depends on the workload).

* Added query source information for ``mysql:queries`` service
  in ``pmm-admin list`` output.

* Added ``purge`` command to purge metrics data on the server.

* Updated ``mongodb_exporter`` with RocksDB support and various fixes.

* Removed ``--nodetype`` and ``--replset`` flags for ``mongodb:metrics``.
  The ``--cluster`` flag is now optional.

  It is recommended to re-add ``mongodb:metrics`` service
  and purge existing MongoDB metrics using the ``purge`` command.

* Enabled monitoring of file descriptors
  (requires re-adding ``linux:metrics`` service).

* Improved full uninstallation when PMM Server is unreachable.

* Added time drift check between server and client
  to `pmm-admin check-network` output.
