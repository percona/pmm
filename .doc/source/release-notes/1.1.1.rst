:PMM Server: https://hub.docker.com/r/percona/pmm-server/
:PMM Client: https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm-client/

For install instructions, see :ref:`deploy-pmm`.

This release introduces new ways for running *PMM Server*:

* :ref:`Run PMM Server as a virtual appliance <pmm.deploying.server.virtual-appliance>`
* :ref:`Run PMM Server using Amazon Machine Image (AMI) <run-server-ami>`

.. note:: These images are experimental and not recommended for production.
   It is best to :ref:`run PMM Server using Docker <run-server-docker>`.

There are no changes compared to previous
:ref:`1.1.0 Beta <1.1.0beta>` release,
except small fixes for MongoDB metrics dashboards.
