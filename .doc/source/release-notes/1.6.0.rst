|percona| announces the release of |pmm.name| |release|. In this release, |pmm|
|grafana| metrics are made available in the *Advanced Data Exploration*
dashboard. The integration with |myrocks| has been improved and its data are now
collected from *SHOW GLOBAL STATUS*.

The |mongodb| exporter now features two new metrics: **mongodb_up** to inform if the

New Features
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1773`: |pmm| |grafana| specific metrics have been added to the
  *Advanced Data Exploration* dashboard.

Improvements
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1485`: Updated |myrocks| integration: |myrocks| data is now collected
  entirely from :program:`SHOW GLOBAL STATUS` and we have eliminated
  :program:`SHOW ENGINE ROCKSDB STATUS` as a data source in **mysqld_exporter**.
- :pmmbug:`1895`: Update |grafana| to version 4.6.3:

  - Alert list: Now shows alert state changes even after adding manual
    annotations on dashboard `#9951
    <https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/9951>`_
  - Alerting: Fixes bug where rules evaluated as firing when all conditions was
    false and using OR operator. `#9318
    <https://github.com/grafana/grafana/issues/9318>`_

- :pmmbug:`1586`: The **mongodb_exporter** exporter exposes two new metrics:
  **mongodb_up** informing if the |mongodb| server is running and
  **mongodb_scrape_errors_total** informing the total number of times an error
  occurred when scraping |mongodb|.
- :pmmbug:`1764`: Various small **mongodb_exporter** improvements
- :pmmbug:`1942`: Improved the consistency of using labels in all |prometheus|
  related dashboards.

- :pmmbug:`1937`: Added the *CPU Utilization Details (Cores)* dashboard to
  |metrics-monitor|.
- :pmmbug:`1887`: Improved the help text for |pmm-admin| to provide
  more information about exporter options.
- :pmmbug:`1939`: In |metrics-monitor|, two new dashboards have been
  added to provide more information about |prometheus| exporters. The
  *Prometheus Exporters Overview* dashboard provides a summary of how
  exporters utilize system resources and the *Prometheus Exporter Status*
  dashboard tracks the performance of each |prometheus| exporter.
