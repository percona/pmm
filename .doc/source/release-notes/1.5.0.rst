Percona Monitoring and Management |release|
================================================================================

:Date: November 23, 2017

|percona| announces the release of |pmm.name|
|release|, with a focus on the following features:

- Enhanced support for |mysql| on |amazon| RDS and |amazon| Aurora – Dedicated |amazon|
  Aurora dashboard offers maximum visibility into key database characteristics,
  eliminating the need for additional monitoring nodes.  We renamed |amazon| RDS
  OS Metrics to |amazon| RDS /
  |amazon|
  |mysql| Metrics
- Simpler configuration – |pmm.name| now offers easier
  configuration of key |amazon| RDS and |amazon| Aurora settings via a web interface
- One-click data collection – One button retrieves vital information on server
  performance to assist with troubleshooting
- Improved interface – A simple, consistent user interface makes it faster and
  more fluid to switch between |qan.name| and |metrics-monitor|

*Highlights from our new Amazon RDS / Aurora MySQL Metrics dashboard:*

dashboard known as |pmm|.

With this release, |pmm.name| introduces a new deployment
option via AWS Marketplace.  This is in addition to our distribution method of
`Amazon Machine Images (AMI)
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/deploy/server/ami.html>`_.

In this release, |grafana| and |prometheus| have been upgraded. |pmm| now includes
|grafana| 4.6.1. One of the most prominent features that the upgraded |grafana|
offers is the support of annotations. You can mark a point or select a region in
a graph and give it a meaningful description. For more information, see the
`release highlights <http://docs.grafana.org/guides/whats-new-in-v4-6/>`_.

|prometheus| version 1.8.2, shipped with this release, offers a number of bug
fixes. For more information, see the
`Prometheus change log <https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#182--2017-11-04>`_.
