Percona Monitoring and Management 1.17.0
================================================================================

:Date: November 20, 2018

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

In release 1.17.0 we made 6 improvements and fixed 11 bugs.

Although we patched a bug this release related to a Grafana CVE announcement,
previous releases since 1.10 (April 2018) were not vulnerable, and we encourage
you to see our `Grafana CVE blog post <https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/11/20/how-cve-2018-19039-affects-percona-monitoring-and-management>`_ for further details.

Dashboard Improvements
================================================================================

We updated five Dashboards with improved Tooltips - If you haven't seen this
before, hover your mouse over the ``i`` icon in the top left of most graph
elements, and you'll see a new box appear.  This box provides a brief
description of what the graph displays, along with links to related
documentation resources so you can learn further.  We hope you find the content
useful!
