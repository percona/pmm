================================================================================
|pmm.name| |release|
================================================================================

:Date: April 4, 2018

There are a number of significant updates in |release| that we hope you
will like, some of the key highlights include:

- Faster loading of the index page: We have enabled performance
  optimizations using |gzip| and |http2|.
- AWS improvements: We have added metrics from CloudWatch RDS to 6
  dashboards, as well as changed our |aws| add instance workflow, and
  made some changes to credentials handling.
- |percona| Snapshot Server: If you are a |percona| Customer you can now
  securely share your dashboards with |percona| Engineers.
- Exporting |pmm-server| logs: Retrieve logs from |pmm-server| for
  troubleshooting using single button-click, avoiding the need to log
  in manually to the docker container.
- Low RAM support: We have reduced the memory requirement so
  |pmm-server| will run on systems with 512MB
- Dashboard improvements: We ave changed |mongodb| instance
  identification for |mongodb| graphs, and set maximum graph Y-axis on
  Prometheus Exporter Status dashboard

|aws| Improvements
================================================================================

CloudWatch RDS metrics
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Since we are already consuming |amazon-cloudwatch| metrics and persisting them in
|prometheus|, we have improved 6 node-specific dashboards to now display
|amazon-rds| node-level metrics:

- Cross_Server (Network Traffic)
- Disk Performance (Disk Latency)
- Home Dashboard (Network IO)
- MySQL Overview (Disk Latency, Network traffic)
- Summary Dashboard (Network Traffic)
- System Overview (Network Traffic)

AWS Add Instance changes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have changed our |aws| add instance interface and workflow to be more clear on
information needed to add an |amazon-aurora| |mysql| or |amazon-rds| |mysql|
instance. We have provided some clarity on how to locate your |aws| credentials.

|aws| Settings
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We have improved our documentation to highlight connectivity best practices, and
authentication options - IAM Role or IAM User Access Key.

Low RAM Support
================================================================================


You can now run PMM Server on instances with memory as low as 512MB RAM, which
means you can deploy to  the free tier of many cloud providers if you want to
experiment with PMM.  Our memory calculation is now:

.. code-block:: bash

    METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED=$(( (${MEMORY_AVAIABLE} - 256*1024*1024) / 100 * 40 ))
    if [[ $METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED < $((128*1024*1024)) ]]; then
        METRICS_MEMORY_MULTIPLIED=$((128*1024*1024))
    fi

|percona| Snapshot Server
================================================================================    

Snapshots are a way of sharing |pmm| dashboards via a link to individuals who do
not normally have access to your |pmm-server|.  If you are a |percona| Customer
you can now securely share your dashboards with |percona| Engineers.  We have
replaced the button for sharing to the |grafana| publicly hosted platform onto one
administered by |percona|.  Your dashboard will be written to |percona|
snapshots and only |percona| Engineers will be able to retrieve the data.  We
will be expiring old snapshots automatically at 90 days, but when sharing you
will have the option to configure a shorter retention period.

Export of |pmm-server| Logs
================================================================================

In this release, the logs from |pmm-server| can be exported using single
button-click, avoiding the need to log in manually to the docker container.
This simplifies the troubleshooting process of a |pmm-server|, and especially for
Percona Customers, this feature will provide a more consistent data gathering
task that you will perform on behalf of requests from |percona| Engineers.

Faster Loading of the Index Page
================================================================================

In version 1.8.0, the index page was redesigned to reveal more useful
information about the performance of your hosts as well an immediate access to
essential components of PMM, however the index page had to load much data
dynamically resulting in a noticeably longer load time. In this release we
enabled |gzip| and |http2| to improve the load time of the index page. The
following screenshots demonstrate the results of our tests on webpagetest.org
where we reduce page load time by half.  We will continue to look for
opportunities to improve the performance of the index page and expect that when
we upgrade to Prometheus 2 we will see another improvement.
