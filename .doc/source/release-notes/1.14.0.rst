Percona Monitoring and Management 1.14.0
================================================================================

:Date: September 5, 2018

*PMM* (`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL| and |MongoDB| performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for |MySQL| and |MongoDB| servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

We\'ve included a plethora of visual improvements in this release, including:

* PostgreSQL Metrics Collection - Visualize PostgreSQL performance!
* Identify New Queries in Query Analytics
* New Dashboard: Compare System Parameters
* New Dashboard: PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA Wait Events Analysis
* Dashboard Updates - Advanced Data Exploration, MyRocks, TokuDB, InnoDB Metrics
* Disable SSL between Prometheus and Exporters
* Dashboards grouped by Folder - We\'ve organized the Dashboard drop-down to present a cleaner interface

We addressed 16 new features and improvements, and fixed 20 bugs.

PostgreSQL Metrics Collection
================================================================================

The PMM team is very proud to bring you native support for PostgreSQL! We\'ve shipped a new dashboard called PostgreSQL Overview, and we now provide the ability to add PostgreSQL instances as native, first-class citizens as part of PMM.  This means you can add PostgreSQL + Linux monitoring capabilities through the standard ``pmm-admin add postgresql`` syntax, see our documentation links for more details!

Identify New Queries in Query Analytics
================================================================================

A long-awaited feature is the ability to visually identify new queries that have appeared in Query Analytics - those queries who\'s first seen time is within the selected time range. New queries will be highlighted in a soft blue band for quick identification, and we\'ve provided a button called First Seen which you can toggle to display only those newly seen queries.  A common use case for this feature is potentially during code release / deployments, where you want to review which new queries have been deployed and to review their performance characteristics.

New Dashboard: Compare System Parameters
================================================================================

We\'ve introduced a new dashboard to let you compare System Parameters across multiple servers so at a glance you can understand provisioning or configuration differences.  This might be of help when comparing a pool of identical slaves or other logical groups of instances.

New Dashboard: PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA Wait Events Analysis
================================================================================

We\'ve added a new dashboard that lets you drill down into great detail on one or several PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA wait event categories in order to visualize them over time.

Dashboards grouped by Folder
================================================================================

At long last we\'ve addressed the sprawl of the long list of 30+ Dashboards, and grouped them into categories which match the pre-existing right-side navigation system.  This should leave you with a more organized, less cluttered list of Dashboards.

Dashboard Updates - Advanced Data Exploration, MyRocks, TokuDB, InnoDB Metrics
================================================================================

We\'ve improved four dashboards with minor but helpful improvements:

* Advanced Data Exploration dashboard with the addition of a graph element plotting the Metric Rates, which will help you understand the scraping efficiency of this metric series, or whether scrapes have failed / are failing.  
* InnoDB Metrics to present the graph elements in two columns - previously we\'d inconsistently use three columns or two columns, making it hard to visualize trends across graphs.
* MyRocks formulas were improved to be more precise
* TokuDB has many new graphs to expand our coverage of this Storage Engine

Disable SSL between PMM Server and Exporters
================================================================================

Lastly, we\'ve delivered on a feature request from a Percona Customer to optionally disable SSL between PMM Server and Exporters, with the advantage that if you do not need encrypted traffic for your metric series, you can reduce the CPU overhead on PMM Server.  We\'d love to hear your feedback on this feature!
