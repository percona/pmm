`Percona Monitoring and Management <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/index.html>`_ (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring |MySQL|, |MongoDB|, and |postgresql| performance.

The PMM 1.17.3 release provides fixes for the following bugs.

Fixed Bugs
================================================================================

* :pmmbug:`5089` and :pmmbug:`5119`: The handlebars package was updated to
  version 4.5.3 because of the Prototype Pollution vulnerability in it
  (CVE-2019-19919), and the serialize-javascript package was updated to version
  2.1.1 because of the possibility of regular expressions cross-site scripting
  vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-16769); PMM versions were not affected by these
  vulnerabilities, as both packages were used as build dependencies only
* :pmmbug:`4923`: Textfile collector was not working after the upgrade from
  older versions on CentOS 7, producing a lot of errors in the log, due to the
  ``textfile_collector`` folder incorrectly created as ``textfile-collector``
* :pmmbug:`5075`: Switching to First Seen queries in Query Analytics resulted in
  always displaying first seen queries even after switching back.
* :pmmbug:`5014` and :pmmbug:`5273`: The LVM logical volumes autoresize problem
  on new AWS deployments resulted in "no space left on device" errors
* :pmmbug:`4685`: After removing all MongoDB servers from a cluster, the
  drop-down list on the MongoDB Overview dashboard still included the cluster
  name, because dashboards were fully refreshed on load only, irrelative to the
  selected time range
* :pmmbug:`4789`: the "Metrics" and "Query's first seen" text labels were
  partially overlapping in the Query Analytics dashboard
* :pmmbug:`5231`: Panic errors were present in the ``rds_exporter`` log after
  adding an RDS instance from the second AWS account, leaving user no
  possibility to add Databases from several AWS accounts for monitoring
