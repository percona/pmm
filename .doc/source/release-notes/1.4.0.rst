Percona announces the release of Percona Monitoring and Management |release|.

This release introduces the support of external Prometheus exporters so that you
can create dashboards in the Metrics monitor even for the monitoring services
other than those provided with PMM client packages. To attach an existing
external Prometheus exporter, run :command:`pmm-admin add external:metrics NAME_OF_EXPORTER
URL:PORT`.

The list of attached monitoring services is now available not only in the
tabular format but also as a JSON file to enable automatic verification of your
configuration. To view the list of monitoring services in the JSON format run
:command:`pmm-admin list --json`.

In this release, |prometheus| and |grafana| have
been upgraded. |prometheus| version 1.7.2, shipped with this
release, offers a number of bug fixes that will contribute to its
smooth operation inside PMM. For more information, see `the Prometheus
change log
<https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/blob/v1.7.2/CHANGELOG.md#172--2017-09-26>`_.

Version 4.5.2 of |grafana|, included in this release of PMM, offers a
number of new tools that will facilitate data analysis in PMM:

- New ``query editor`` for Prometheus expressions which features syntax highlighting
  and autocompletion for metrics, functions and range vectors.

- ``Query inspector`` which provides detailed information about the query. The
  primary goal of graph inspector is to enable analyzing a graph which does not
  display data as expected.

The complete list of new features in :program:`Grafana` 4.5.0 is
available from `What's New in Grafana v4.5
<http://docs.grafana.org/guides/whats-new-in-v4-5/>`_.

For install and upgrade instructions, see :ref:`deploy-pmm`.

New features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :pmmbug:`1520`: Prometheus upgraded to version 1.7.2.
- :pmmbug:`1521`: Grafana upgraded to version 4.5.2.
- :pmmbug:`1091`: The :command:`pmm-admin list` produces a JSON document as
  output if the :option:`--json` option is supplied.
- :pmmbug:`507`: :ref:`External exporters are supported <pmm.pmm-admin.external-monitoring-service.adding>` with |pmm-admin|.
- :pmmbug:`1622`: :program:`docker` images of PMM Server are
  `available for downloading
  <https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm/>`_ as :program:`tar`
  packages.

Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- :pmmbug:`1172`: In some cases, the ``TABLES`` section of a query in
  :program:`QAN` could contain no data and display the *List of tables is empty*
  error. The ``Query`` and ``Explain`` sections had the relevant values.
- :pmmbug:`1519`: A Prometheus instance could be forced to shut down if it
  contained too many targets (more than 50).  When started the next time,
  Prometheus initiated a time consuming crash recovery routine which took long
  on large installations.
