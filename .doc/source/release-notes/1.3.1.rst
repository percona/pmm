Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* :pmmbug:`1271`: In QAN, when the user selected a database host with no
  queries, the query monitor could still show metrics.
* :pmmbug:`1512`: When reached from :program:`Grafana`, :program:`QAN`
  would open its home page. Now, :program:`QAN` opens and automatically
  selects the database host and time range active in :program:`Grafana`.
* :pmmbug:`1523`: User defined Prometheus memory settings were not
  honored, potentially causing performance issues in high load
  environments.

Other bug fixes in this release:
:pmmbug:`1452`,
:pmmbug:`1515`.
