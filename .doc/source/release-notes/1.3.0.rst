.. _1.3.0:

================================================================================
Percona Monitoring and Management |release|
================================================================================

:Date: September 26, 2017

For install and upgrade instructions, see :ref:`deploy-pmm`.

In release |release|, Percona Monitoring and Management introduces
a basic support for the MyRocks storage engine. There is a special
dashboard in :program:`Metrics Monitor` where the essential metrics of
MyRocks are presented as separate graphs. And :program:`Metrics
Monitor` graphs now feature on-demand descriptions.

There are many improvements to QAN (Query Analytics) both in the user interface
design and in its capabilities. In this release, :program:`QAN` starts
supporting all types of MongoDB queries.

:program:`Orchestrator` is not enabled by default because leaving it in a
non-configured state was confusing to users. :ref:`It is still possible to
enable it <pmm.docker.additional-option>`.

Improvements
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  This problem is not observed in the new design of :program:`QAN`.
