Changes in PMM Server
=====================

* :pmmbug:`667`: Fixed the *Latency* graph
  in the *ProxySQL Overview* dashboard
  to plot microsecond values instead of milliseconds.

* :pmmbug:`800`: Fixed the *InnoDB Page Splits* graph
  in the *MySQL InnoDB Metrics Advanced* dashboard
  to show correct page merge success ratio.

  from *MySQL Overview* and *MongoDB Overview* dashboards.
  The links also pass selected host and time period values.
