Visual Explain in Query Analytics
================================================================================

We’re working on substantial changes to Query Analytics and the first part to
roll out is something that users of Percona Toolkit may recognize – we\’ve
introduced a new element called Visual Explain based on pt-visual-explain.  This
functionality transforms MySQL EXPLAIN output into a left-deep tree
representation of a query plan, in order to mimic how the plan is represented
inside MySQL.  This is of primary benefit when investigating tables that are
joined in some logical way so that you can understand in what order the loops
are executed by the MySQL query optimizer. In this example we are demonstrating
the output of a single table lookup vs two table join:

.. _release.1-12-0.innodb-compression-metrics-dashboard:

InnoDB Compression Metrics Dashboard
================================================================================

A great feature of MySQL\’s InnoDB storage engine includes compression of data
that is transparently handled by the database, saving you space on disk, while
reducing the amount of I/O to disk as fewer disk blocks are required to store
the same amount of data, thus allowing you to reduce your storage costs.  We\’ve
deployed a new dashboard that helps you understand the most important
characteristics of InnoDB\’s Compression.  Here\’s a sample of visualizing
Compression and Decompression attempts, alongside the overall Compression
Success Ratio graph:

.. _release.1-12-0.mysql-command-handler-compare-dashboard:

MySQL Command/Handler Compare Dashboard
================================================================================

We have introduced a new dashboard that lets you do side-by-side comparison of
Command (Com_*) and Handler statistics.  A common use case would be to compare
servers that share a similar workload, for example across MySQL instances in a
pool of replicated slaves.  In this example I am comparing two servers under
identical sysbench load, but exhibiting slightly different performance
characteristics:

The number of servers you can select for comparison is unbounded, but depending
on the screen resolution you might want to limit to 3 at a time for a 1080
screen size.
