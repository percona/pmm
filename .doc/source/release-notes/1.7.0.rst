|pmm.name| |release|
================================================================================

:Date: January 31, 2018

|percona| announces the release of |pmm.name| |release|.  |info.pmm.about|.

This release features improved support for external services, which enables a
|pmm-server| to store and display metrics for any available |prometheus|
exporter. For example, you could deploy the postgres_exporter and use |pmm|
external services feature to store |postgresql| metrics in |pmm|.  Immediately,
you will see these new metrics in the |dbd.advanced-data-exploration| dashboard. Then
you could leverage many of the pre-developed |postgresql| dashboards available
on Grafana.com, and with a minimal amount of edits have a working |postgresql|
dashboard in |pmm|!  Watch for an upcoming blog post to demonstrate a
walk-through of this unlocked functionality.

New Features
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1949`: New dashboard: |dbd.mysql-amazon-aurora-metrics|.

Improvements
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1712`: Improve external exporters to let you easily add data
  monitoring from an arbitrary |prometheus| exporter you have running on your
  host.
- :pmmbug:`1510`: Rename *swap in* and *swap out* labels to be more specific and
  help clearly see the direction of data flow for *Swap In* and *Swap Out*. The
  new labels are *Swap In (Reads)* and *Swap Out (Writes)* accordingly.
- :pmmbug:`1966`: Remove |grafana| from list of exporters on dashboard to
  eliminate confusion with existing |grafana| in the list of exporters on the
  current version of the dashboard.
- :pmmbug:`1974`: Add the *mongodb_up* in the Exporter Status dashboard. The new
  graph is added to maintain consistency of information about exporters. This is
  done based on new metrics implemented in :pmmbug:`1586`.

  
Bug fixes
================================================================================

- :pmmbug:`1967`: Inconsistent formulas in |prometheus| dashboards.
- :pmmbug:`1986`: Signing out with HTTP auth enabled leaves the browser *signed in*.
