# List of available alert templates

The table below lists all the alert templates available in Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM). 

This list includes both built-in templates (accessible to all PMM users), and customer-only templates.

To access the customer-only templates, you must be a Percona customer and [connect PMM to Percona Platform](../how-to/integrate-platform.md) using a Percona Account.

| **MongoDB read tickets** | Tracks read ticket availability in the WiredTiger storage engine and alerts when it falls below set thresholds. Helps optimize read performance and identify potential bottlenecks. | Customer-only | MongoDB |
| **MongoDB replication lag is high** | Monitors replication lag and alerts when it exceeds acceptable thresholds. Crucial for maintaining data consistency across replicas and identifying synchronization issues. | Customer-only | MongoDB |
| **MongoDB ReplicaSet has no primary** | Detects when a replica set loses its primary node and alerts users. Indicates that the cluster is in read-only mode, potentially affecting write operations and overall database functionality. | Customer-only | MongoDB |
| **MongoDB member is in unusual state** | Identifies and alerts when replica set members enter unusual states such as Recovering, Startup, or Rollback. Helps maintain cluster health and performance by enabling quick intervention. | Customer-only | MongoDB |
| **MongoDB write tickets** | Monitors write ticket availability in the WiredTiger storage engine and alerts when it falls below set thresholds. Aids in optimizing write performance and identifying potential bottlenecks. | Customer-only | MongoDB |
| **MySQL down** | Monitors MySQL instance availability and alerts when any MySQL service becomes unreachable. Enables quick response to maintain database services. | All users | MySQL |
| **MySQL replication running IO** | Tracks MySQL replication I/O thread status and alerts if it stops running on a replica. Crucial for ensuring data is being received from the primary server. | All users | MySQL |
| **MySQL replication running SQL** | Monitors MySQL replication SQL thread status and alerts if it stops running on a replica. Essential for verifying that received data is being applied correctly to maintain data consistency. | All users | MySQL |
| **MySQL restarted** | Detects recent MySQL restarts, alerting if an instance has been restarted within the last 5 minutes (default threshold). Aids in investigating unexpected downtime and potential issues. | All users | MySQL |
| **MySQL connections in use** | Tracks MySQL connection usage and alerts when the percentage of active connections exceeds 80% of the maximum allowed (default threshold). Helps prevent performance degradation due to connection overload. | All users | MySQL |
| **PostgreSQL down** | Detects when PostgreSQL instances become unavailable, enabling quick response to maintain database services. Provides details about affected services and nodes. | All users | PostgreSQL |
| **PostgreSQL restarted** | Identifies recent PostgreSQL restarts, alerting if an instance has been restarted within the last 5 minutes (default threshold). Aids in investigating unexpected downtime and potential issues. | All users | PostgreSQL |
| **PostgreSQL connections in use** | Monitors PostgreSQL connection usage and alerts when the percentage of active connections exceeds 80% of the maximum allowed (default threshold). Helps prevent performance degradation due to excessive connections. | All users | PostgreSQL |
| **PostgreSQL index bloat is high** | Detects excessive index bloat and alerts users. Helps identify performance degradation due to bloated indexes, enabling timely maintenance to improve query performance. | Customer-only | PostgreSQL |
| **PostgreSQL high number of dead tuples** | Monitors the accumulation of dead tuples in relations and alerts when they exceed set thresholds. Indicates potential issues with vacuum settings and helps optimize storage and query performance. | Customer-only | PostgreSQL |
| **PostgreSQL has a high number of statement timeouts** | Tracks and alerts on frequent query cancellations due to statement timeouts. Helps identify various issues such as high load, poorly written queries, or inadequate resource allocation. | Customer-only | PostgreSQL |
