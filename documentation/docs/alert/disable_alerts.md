# Disable Percona Alerting

Percona Alerting is enabled by default in the PMM Settings. This feature adds the **Percona templated alerts** option on the **Alerting** menu.

If for some reason you want to disable PMM Alert templates and keep only Grafana-managed alerts:
{.power-number}

1. Go to **PMM Configuration > Settings > Advanced settings**.
2. Disable the **Alerting** option. The **Alerting** menu will now display only Grafana-managed alert rules.
