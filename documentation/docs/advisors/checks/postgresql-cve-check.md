# Security vulnerabilities 

## Description

This check scans the running PostgreSQL version and patch release for security vulnerabilities listed on the [PostgreSQL Security Information Page](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/).  If any known vulnerabilities affect the checked instance, the CVE details will be reported. 


## Resolution

Percona recommends updating the existing version of PostgreSQL to the patch level which addresses the CVE reference for the running instance of PostgreSQL.  

Compare the CVE references provided in the Advisor check to those on the [security page](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/), and take the necessary actions to fix the issue.
