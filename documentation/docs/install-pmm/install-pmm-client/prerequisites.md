# Prerequisites for PMM Client

Before installing PMM Client, ensure your environment meets these requirements.

## Quick requirements checklist

✓ **Hardware**: 64-bit system (x86_64 or ARM64) with at least 100 MB storage  
✓ **OS**: Modern 64-bit Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, RHEL, Oracle Linux, Amazon Linux 2023)  
✓ **Network**: Connectivity to PMM Server (ports 80/443)  
✓ **Software**: curl, gnupg, sudo, wget  
✓ **Database**: Appropriate monitoring user credentials  

## System requirements

PMM Client is designed to be lightweight but requires:

- **Architecture**: x86_64 or ARM64
- **RAM**: Minimal (100-200 MB per monitored database instance)
- **Storage**:

    - 100 MB for installation
    - VM Agent reserves 1 GB for caching during network outages

For comprehensive hardware specifications, see [Hardware and system requirements](../plan-pmm-installation/hardware_and_system.md#pmm-client).

## Network connectivity

PMM Client requires these network connections:

| Connection | Port | Purpose |
|------------|------|---------|
| PMM Client > PMM Server | 443 (or 80) | Metrics reporting and management |
| PMM Client > Database instances | Varies by DB type | Collection of monitoring data |

For a complete list of ports and detailed network configuration options, see [Network and firewall requirements](../plan-pmm-installation/network_and_firewall.md).

## Required software

- Ensure these packages are installed before proceeding: curl, gnupg, sudo, wget.

- For Docker-based deployment, you'll also need [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/){:target="_blank"} properly installed and configured. 

## Database monitoring requirements

To ensure successful database monitoring with PMM, confirm the following:

- **Monitoring users**: Create database accounts with the required permissions  
- **Log access**: Enable file system access to database logs (where applicable)  
- **Performance Schema**: Recommended for enhanced MySQL monitoring
