# Install PMM Client with Percona repositories
PMM Client supports both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.  
On Debian or Red Hat Linux, install `percona-release` and use a Linux package manager (`apt`/`dnf`) to install PMM Client.
The package manager will automatically select the appropriate version for your system architecture.
