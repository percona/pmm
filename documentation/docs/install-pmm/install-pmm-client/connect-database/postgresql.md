# Connect PostgreSQL databases to PMM

Connect your PostgreSQL databases—whether self-hosted or running in the cloud—to Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) for comprehensive performance monitoring and analysis.

PMM Client supports collecting metrics from PostgreSQL-based database systems:

- [PostgreSQL][PostgreSQL]
- [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL][Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL]

For monitoring Amazon RDS PostgreSQL instances, see [Connect Amazon RDS instance](../connect-database/aws.md).

??? info "Setup process at a glance"
    These are the high-level steps for configuring PostgreSQL monitoring in PMM:
    {.power-number}

    1. **[Prerequisites](#before-you-start)**: Ensure PMM Server is running and PMM Client is installed
    2. **[Create PMM user](#create-a-database-account-for-pmm)**: `CREATE USER pmm WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'StrongPassword'`
    3. **[Configure extension](#choose-a-monitoring-extension)**: Set up `pg_stat_statements` or `pg_stat_monitor`
    4. **[Add service](#add-service-to-pmm)**: Use PMM UI or command line to add the PostgreSQL instance
    5. **[Verify connection](#check-the-service)**: Check PMM Inventory and dashboards for data. 

## Before you start

Check that:

- [PMM Server is installed](../../install-pmm-server/index.md) and running with a known IP address accessible from the client node.
- [PMM Client is installed](../../install-pmm-client/index.md) and the [nodes are registered with PMM Server](../../register-client-node/index.md).
- You have superuser (root) access on the client host.
- You have superuser access to any database servers that you want to monitor.

PMM follows [PostgreSQL's end-of-life policy][POSTGRESQL_VERSIONING]. For specific details on supported platforms and versions, see [Percona's Software Platform Lifecycle page][PERCONA_LIFECYCLE].

## Create a database account for PMM

PMM requires a dedicated database account with appropriate permissions to collect metrics effectively. We recommend creating a PMM database account that can connect to the postgres database with the SUPERUSER role.

=== "Standard PostgreSQL"

    To create a user with the SUPERUSER role:
    {.power-number}
    
    1. Create a user with SUPERUSER role:
    
        ```sql
        CREATE USER pmm WITH SUPERUSER ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'strong_password';
        ```
    
    2. Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file to enable local login:
    
        ```conf
        local   all             pmm                                md5
        # TYPE  DATABASE        USER        ADDRESS                METHOD
        ```

=== "Amazon RDS/Aurora PostgreSQL"

    For RDS instances where SUPERUSER cannot be assigned directly:
    {.power-number}
    
    1. Create the user:
    
        ```sql
        CREATE USER pmm WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'strong_password';
        ```
    
    2. Grant the `rds_superuser` role:
    
        ```sql
        GRANT rds_superuser TO pmm;
        ```
    
    3. Optionally, set a connection limit (only if the user is not a SUPERUSER):
    
        ```sql
        ALTER USER pmm CONNECTION LIMIT 10;
        ```

### Configure authentication

After creating the database user, complete the configuration:
{.power-number}

1. Reload the PostgreSQL configuration:

```sh
su - postgres
psql -c "select pg_reload_conf()"
```

2. Verify the PMM user can connect locally:
``` sh
psql postgres pmm -c "\conninfo"
```

3. Enter the password for the pmm user when prompted:

## Choose a monitoring extension

### PostgreSQL monitoring extensions comparison
Decide which database extension to use, and configure your database server for it. 

Choose:

- [`pg_stat_statements`](#configure-pg_stat_statements) when you need a lightweight, built-in solution with minimal overhead
- [`pg_stat_monitor`](#configure-pg_stat_monitor) when you need comprehensive monitoring capabilities with more detailed insights into query performance:

| Aspect | **pg_stat_statements** | **pg_stat_monitor** |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Origin & packaging** | • Official PostgreSQL extension<br>• Part of `postgresql-contrib` package on Linux | • Developed by Percona<br>• Requires separate installation |
| **Key features** | ✔ Basic query statistics<br>✔ Simple aggregation<br>✔ Minimal overhead<br>✔ Query timing and execution counts | ✔ Enhanced metrics collection<br>✔ Bucket-based aggregation<br>✔ Query examples<br>✔ Histogram data<br>✔ Includes all pg_stat_statements features |
| **Best for** | ✔ Development environments<br>✔ Simple monitoring needs<br>✔ Resource-constrained servers | ✔ Production environments<br>✔ Detailed query analysis<br>✔ Performance tuning |
| **Installation complexity** | ⚠ Low | ⚠ Medium |
| **Benefits** | • Part of official PostgreSQL<br>• Minimal overhead<br>• Simple to set up and use | • Builds on pg_stat_statements features<br>• Bucket-based time-series analysis<br>• Query examples for troubleshooting<br>• More accurate performance data |
| **Drawbacks** | • No aggregated statistics or histograms<br>• No Query Examples<br>• Limited metrics collection | • Slightly higher resource overhead<br>• Requires separate installation<br>• More complex configuration |

For a more detailed comparison of extensions, see the [pg_stat_monitor documentation](https://docs.percona.com/pg-stat-monitor/user_guide.html).

### Configure `pg_stat_statements`

#### Installation

- For Debian/Ubuntu:

    !!! hint "Root permissions"
        ```sh
        apt install -y postgresql-contrib
        ```

- For Red Hat/CentOS:

    !!! hint "Root permissions"
        ```sh
        yum install -y postgresql-contrib
        ```

#### Configuration

To configure the extension:
{.power-number}

1. Add these lines to your `postgresql.conf` file:

    ```conf
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
    track_activity_query_size = 2048 # Increase tracked query string size
    pg_stat_statements.track = all   # Track all statements including nested
    track_io_timing = on             # Capture read/write stats
    ```

2. Restart the database server. After the restart, the extension starts capturing statistics from every database.

3. Install the extension:

    ```sh
    psql postgres postgres -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements SCHEMA public"
    ```
    
    This command creates the view where you can access the collected statistics.

!!! note alert alert-primary ""
    We recommend that you create the extension for the `postgres` database. In this case, you receive access to the statistics collected from every database.    

You can now [add the service](#add-service-to-pmm).

### Configure `pg_stat_monitor`

#### Compatible versions 

`pg_stat_monitor` has been tested with:

- PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL versions 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

#### Installation

- With Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL: Install via your Linux package manager. See [Installing Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL][PERCONA_POSTGRESQL_INSTALL].
- With standard PostgreSQL: Download and compile from source code. See [Installing `pg_stat_monitor`][PG_STAT_MONITOR_INSTALL].

#### Configuration

To configure `pg_stat_monitor`effectively:
{.power-number}

1. Add pg_stat_monitor to `shared_preload_library` in `postgresql.conf` file:

    ```ini
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_monitor'
    ```

    If you use both `pg_stat_statements` and `pg_stat_monitor` list `pg_stat_statements` first:

        ```ini
        shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements, pg_stat_monitor'
        ```

2. Configure query tracking parameters in your `postgresql.conf` file:
    ```ini
    pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_query_max_len = 2048
    ```

    !!! caution "Parameter effects"
        It is important to set maximal length of query to 2048 characters or more for QAN to provide correct information about query.

    You can configure additional parameters to enhance monitoring capabilities:
    
    ```ini
    # Replace query values with placeholders (recommended)
    pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_normalized_query = 1
    
    # Enable query plan capture
    pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_enable_query_plan = 1
    ```

    If the value for `pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_normalized_query` is set to 1, the actual query values are replaced by placeholders. If the value is 0, the examples are given in QAN. Examples can be found in QAN details tab example.
    
    If `pg_stat_monitor.pgsm_enable_query_plan` is enabled, the query plans are captured and will be available in the `Plan` tab on the Query Analytics dashboard.

    !!! tip "Additional settings"
        View all available settings with:
        ```sql
        SELECT * FROM pg_stat_monitor_settings;
        ```
        
    For complete parameter documentation, see the [`pg_stat_monitor` online documentation](https://docs.percona.com/pg-stat-monitor/configuration.html).

3. Restart your PostgreSQL instance to activate the extension.

4. Create the extension in a psql session to create the necessary views that allow you to access the collected statistics:

    ```sql
    psql -d postgres -c "CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor;"
     ```

    !!! note "Best practice"
    Create the extension in the postgres database to access statistics collected from all databases in your instance. This provides comprehensive monitoring without needing to enable the extension in each individual database.

5. Verify the extension installation:

    ```sql
    SELECT pg_stat_monitor_version();
    ```

### Bucket-based data aggregation in `pg_stat_monitor`

`pg_stat_monitor` collects and aggregates PostgreSQL statistics using a data structure called a bucket. Multiple buckets are linked together to form a bucket chain.

Each bucket:

- collects data for a specific time period
- has a defined memory allocation
- stores aggregated statistics until expiration or overflow

#### Bucket lifecycle

When a bucket's expiration time is reached, accumulated statistics are reset and data is stored in the next available bucket in the chain.

When all buckets in the chain have been used, the first bucket is reused and its contents are overwritten.

If a bucket fills before its expiration time is reached, data is discarded.

## Add service to PMM

After configuring your database server with the appropriate extension, you need to add it as a service to PMM. You can do this either through the PMM user interface or via the command line.

=== "Using the PMM user interface"

   To add the service from the user interface:
   {.power-number}
   
   1. Go to  **PMM Configuration > Add Service > PostgreSQL**.
   
   2. Enter or select values for the fields.
   
   3. Click **Add service**.
   
   ![!](../../../images/PMM_Add_Instance_PostgreSQL.jpg)
   
   4. If using TLS, check **Use TLS for database connections** and fill in your TLS certificates and key.
   
   ![!](../../../images/PMM_Add_Instance_PostgreSQL_TLS.jpg)
   
   For TLS connection to work SSL needs to be configured in your PostgreSQL instance. Make sure SSL is enabled in the server configuration file `postgresql.conf`, and that hosts are allowed to connect in the client authentication configuration file `pg_hba.conf`. See PostgreSQL documentation on [Secure TCP/IP Connections with SSL].

=== "Using the command line"

   === "Basic setup"
   
       Add an instance with default node name:
       
       ```sh
       pmm-admin add postgresql \
       --username=pmm \
       --password=password \
       --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443 \
       --server-insecure-tls
       ```
       
       The service name will be automatically generated based on the node name.
   
   === "Custom service name"
   
       Add an instance with a specified service name:
       
       ```sh
       pmm-admin add postgresql \
       --username=pmm \
       --password=password \
       --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443 \
       --server-insecure-tls \
       --service-name=SERVICE-NAME
       ```
   
   === "UNIX socket connection"
   
       Add an instance using a UNIX socket:
       
       ```sh
       pmm-admin add postgresql --socket=/var/run/postgresql
       ```
       
       Where:
       - `/var/run/postgresql`: Directory containing the socket
   
   === "TLS connection"
   
       Add an instance with TLS security:
       
       ```sh
       pmm-admin add postgresql --tls \
       --tls-cert-file=PATHTOCERT \
       --tls-ca-file=PATHTOCACERT \
       --tls-key-file=PATHTOKEY \
       --host=HOST \
       --port=PORT \
       --username=USER \
       --service-name=SERVICE-NAME
       ```
       
       Where:
       - `PATHTOCERT`: Path to client certificate file
       - `PATHTOCACERT`: Path to certificate authority file
       - `PATHTOKEY`: Path to client key file
       - `HOST`: Instance hostname or IP
       - `PORT`: PostgreSQL service port number
       - `USER`: Database user allowed to connect via TLS (should match the CN in the client certificate)
       - `SERVICE-NAME`: Name to give to the service within PMM

### Auto-discovery configuration

Auto-discovery dynamically identifies all databases in your PostgreSQL instance. This feature helps balance comprehensive monitoring with resource efficiency.

!!! caution alert alert-warning
    Limiting auto-discovery may result in fewer metrics being captured from the non-primary databases.  Ensure that you set the limit appropriately:

    - **High limits** may impact performance by creating too many connections
    - **Low limits** may result in missing metrics from non-primary databases

=== "Command line configuration"

    Add the database server as a service using one of these example commands. If successful, PMM Client will print `PostgreSQL Service added` with the service's ID and name. Use the `--environment` and `-custom-labels` options to set tags for the service to help identify them.
    
    ??? info "Examples"
    
        Add instance with default node (`<node>-postgresql`).
        
        ```sh
        pmm-admin add postgresql \
        --username=pmm \
        --password=password \
        --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443 \
        --server-insecure-tls
        ```
        
        - `<user name>`: The PostgreSQL PMM user
        - `<password>`: The PostgreSQL user credentials.
        
        The service name will be automatically chosen.
        
        Add instance with specified service name.
        
        ```sh
        pmm-admin add postgresql \
        --username=pmm \
        --password=password \
        --server-url=https://admin:admin@X.X.X.X:443 \
        --server-insecure-tls \
        --service-name=SERVICE-NAME
        ```
        
        Add instance to connect with a UNIX socket.
        
        ```sh
        pmm-admin add postgresql --socket=/var/run/postgresql
        ```
        
        where:
        - `SOCKET`: directory containing the socket

=== "UI configuration"

    By default, **Auto-discovery** is enabled with a server-defined limit of 10 databases.
    
    ![Auto-discovery Enabled](../../../images/PMM_Add_Instance_PostgreSQL_autodiscovery_enabled.png)
    
    When you select **Disabled**, the **Auto-discovery limit** will be set to `-1`.
    
    ![Auto-discovery Disabled](../../../images/PMM_Add_Instance_PostgreSQL_autodiscovery_disabled.png)
    
    For a custom value, select **Custom** and enter your preferred limit.
    
    ![Auto-discovery Custom](../../../images/PMM_Add_Instance_PostgreSQL_autodiscovery_custom.png)

#### Connecting via SSL/TLS

```sh
pmm-admin add postgresql --tls \
--tls-cert-file=PATHTOCERT \
--tls-ca-file=PATHTOCACERT \
--tls-key-file=PATHTOKEY \
--host=HOST \
--port=PORT \
--username=USER \
--service-name=SERVICE-NAME
```

where:

- `PATHTOCERT`: Path to client certificate file.
- `PATHTOCACERT`: Path to certificate authority file.
- `PATHTOKEY`: Path to client key file.
- `HOST`: Instance hostname or IP.
- `PORT`: PostgreSQL service port number.
- `USER`: Database user allowed to connect via TLS. Should match the common name (CN) used in the client certificate.
- `SERVICE`: Name to give to the service within PMM.

## Check the service
After adding a PostgreSQL service, verify that it's properly connected and sending data to PMM.

=== "Using the PMM user interface"
Use the UI to confirm that your service was added and is actively monitored:
{.power-number}

1. Select **Configuration > Inventory**

2. In the **Services** tab, verify:
   - **Service name** matches what you configured
   - **Address** points to your PostgreSQL instance
   - **Status** shows as "Active"

3. In the **Options** column, expand the **Details** section to check that:
   - Agents are properly registered
   - The expected data source is being used

=== "Using command line"
Run this command to view all services:

```sh
pmm-admin inventory list services
```

> **Note**: If using Docker, use `docker exec pmm-client pmm-admin inventory list services`

Look for your PostgreSQL service in the output and verify that its status is "RUNNING".

=== "Check the dashboard data"
Ensure PostgreSQL metrics are flowing and visualized correctly.
{.power-number}

1. Open the **PostgreSQL Instance Summary** dashboard

2. Select your service name from the dropdown

3. Verify that metrics are being displayed

4. Check that the graphs are updating with current data

### Running custom queries

The PostgreSQL exporter can execute custom queries to collect additional metrics beyond what PMM provides by default.

=== "Configuration basics"

   Custom queries must be defined in this directory on the host where the exporter is running:
   ```
   /usr/local/percona/pmm/collectors/custom-queries/postgresql
   ```
   
   Three resolution directories are available:
   
   | Directory | Execution Frequency |
   |-----------|---------------------|
   | `high-resolution/`   | Every 5 seconds  |
   | `medium-resolution/` | Every 10 seconds |
   | `low-resolution/`    | Every 60 seconds |
   
   Choose the appropriate directory based on how frequently you need the data.

=== "Query definition format"

   Create YAML files in the appropriate resolution directory with this structure:
   
   ```yaml
   query_name:
     query: "SELECT statement goes here"
     master: true|false  # Whether to run only on the master
     metrics:
       - metric_name:
           usage: "GAUGE|COUNTER|LABEL|MAPPEDMETRIC|DURATION"
           description: "Human-readable description of the metric"
   ```
   
   **Example**:
   
   ```yaml
   pg_postmaster_uptime:
     query: "select extract(epoch from current_timestamp - pg_postmaster_start_time()) as seconds"
     master: true
     metrics:
       - seconds:
           usage: "GAUGE"
           description: "PostgreSQL service uptime in seconds"
   ```

=== "Metric types"

   | Metric Type | Description | Use Case |
   |-------------|-------------|----------|
   | `GAUGE` | A value that can go up or down | Memory usage, connection count |
   | `COUNTER` | A cumulative value that only increases | Total queries, bytes transferred |
   | `LABEL` | A string value used for labeling | Database name, table name |
   | `MAPPEDMETRIC` | Maps a query result to a numeric value | State conversion (e.g., "on"=1, "off"=0) |
   | `DURATION` | A time duration | Query execution time, lock wait time |
