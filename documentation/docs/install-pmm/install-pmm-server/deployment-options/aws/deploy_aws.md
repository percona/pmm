# Deploy PMM Server on AWS

After [planning your instance size, storage, and network requirements](../aws/plan_aws.md), deploy PMM Server from AWS Marketplace to get monitoring running.

## Launch PMM Server from  AWS Marketplace
To launch  PMM Server via AWS Marketplace:
{.power-number}

1. Go to [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) and search for **Percona Monitoring and Management Server** or [access the PMM Server listing](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-uww55ejutsnom) directly.

2. Click **View purchase options** on the PMM Server listing page, review the terms and conditions, then click **Continue to Configuration**.

3. Select the latest version (recommended), choose the AWS region where you want to deploy PMM, then click **Continue to Launch**.

4. Choose **Launch from Website** to configure and launch directly from the AWS Marketplace or **Launch through EC2** if you prefer launching via the EC2 Management Console for more customization.

5. In the **EC2 Instance Type** field, select an appropriate instance type based on your monitoring needs and anticipated load. For information on instance sizing and storage, see [Plan PMM Server deployment from AWS](../aws/plan_aws.md).

6. In the **VPC Settings** field, choose an existing VPC or create a new one to host your PMM Server. Ensure that the selected VPC has an [Internet Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html) attached to it to be reachable over the Internet

7. In the **Subnet Settings** field, select an existing subnet or create a new one within your VPC.

8. In the **Security Group Settings** field, choose an existing security group or create a new one. Make sure the security group allows inbound traffic on the [Required ports](../aws/plan_aws.md#network-and-security-planning).
9. In the **Key Pair Settings** field, select an existing key pair for SSH access, or create a new one if necessary.

10. Click **Launch** to deploy the PMM Server instance. Once the instance is launched, it will appear in the EC2 console.

11. Assign a meaningful name to the instance to help distinguish it from others in your environment.

### Access the EC2 console

Monitor the deployment progress and access your instance through the EC2 console:
{.power-number}

1. Click the **EC2 Console** link that appears at the top of the confirmation page after launching, or go directly to the [EC2 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/) <!-- linkspector ignore -->

2. Locate your new PMM instance in the EC2 instances table. Initially, its Status shows **Pending** while launching and the Name will be empty.

#### Monitor instance status

Monitor your instance deployment progress through its status checks:

| Status | Description | Expected duration |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Pending** | Instance is being created | 1-2 minutes |
| **Running** | Instance is active and accessible | Ready for use |
| **Status Checks** | System and instance checks | 2-5 minutes |

## Initial PMM Server access

Once your instance status shows "Running" and passes all status checks in the AWS console:
{.power-number}

1. In the EC2 console, select your instance and copy its **IPv4 Public IP** in the instance details or the **Public IP** field from the **Properties** panel:

    ![Public IP Field](../../../../images/aws-marketplace.pmm.ec2.properties.png)

2. Open the IP address in a web browser and log into PMM using the default credentials:
    - **Username:** `admin` 
    - **Password:** Your EC2 instance ID  available in the **Instance ID** field in the EC2 console.
    
    ![PMM Login](../../../../images/PMM_Login.png)

3. Change the default credentials then use the new ones to log in to the PMM Server home page. You will reuse these credentials when configuring PMM Clients on other hosts.

## Configure PMM Server and IP settings
After initial access, configure your PMM Server's security groups and IP addressing.

### SSH access
For SSH access instructions, see [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html).

Replace the user name `ec2-user` with `admin`. You can also add SSH keys later through the **PMM Configuration > Settings > SSH Key** page.
