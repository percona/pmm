# Deploy PMM Server as a Virtual Appliance (OVA)

Deploy PMM Server as a pre-configured virtual machine when you need a standalone monitoring solution with minimal setup. The virtual appliance is ideal for environments where container solutions aren't preferred or for evaluation purposes.

## When to choose OVA deployment

- You prefer traditional VM-based deployments over containers
- You need a solution that works with existing virtualization infrastructure
- You want minimal configuration steps for quick evaluation
- Your environment has limited or no internet connectivity

## Terminology

When working with the PMM Server virtual appliance, it's helpful to understand these terms:

- **Host**: The desktop or server machine running the hypervisor
- **Hypervisor**: Software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware) that runs the guest OS as a virtual machine
- **Guest VM**: Virtual machine running PMM Server (Oracle Linux 9.3)

## OVA file details

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Download page | https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm/{{release}}/ova |
| File name | `pmm-server-{{release}}.ova` |
| VM name | `pmm-Server-{{release_date}}-N` (`N`=build number) |

## VM specifications

The PMM Server virtual appliance comes pre-configured with these specifications:

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| OS | Oracle Linux 9.3 |
| CPU | 1 |
| Base memory | 4096 MB |
| Disks | LVM, 2 physical volumes |
| Disk 1 (`sda`) | VMDK (SCSI, 40 GB) |
| Disk 2 (`sdb`) | VMDK (SCSI, 400 GB) |

!!! note
    You can adjust CPU and memory resources after deployment to match your monitoring needs.

## System requirements

For optimal performance, we recommend:

=== "Minimum (1-30 nodes)"
    - **CPU**: 4 cores
    - **Memory**: 8 GB
    - **Disk**: 100 GB

=== "Recommended (31-100 nodes)"
    - **CPU**: 8 cores
    - **Memory**: 16 GB
    - **Disk**: 200 GB

=== "Large (100+ nodes)"
    - **CPU**: 16+ cores
    - **Memory**: 32+ GB
    - **Disk**: 500+ GB

## Hypervisor compatibility

The PMM Server OVA is compatible with:

- VMware ESXi 6.0 and later
- VMware Workstation 12.0 and later
- VMware Fusion 10.0 and later
- VirtualBox 6.0 and later

## Network requirements

Ensure your network environment allows:

- Outbound internet access for updates (optional)
- Access to monitored database instances
- Access from client browsers to the PMM Server web interface
- Standard ports: 443 (HTTPS), 80 (HTTP, redirects to HTTPS)

See [Network and firewall requirements](../../../plan-pmm-installation/network_and_firewall.md) for full details.

## Default users

PMM Server comes with two pre-configured user accounts that you must secure immediately after installation:

- **admin** (default password: `admin`)
- **root** (default password: `percona`)

Change these default passwords to strong, unique passwords during your first login to prevent unauthorized access.
