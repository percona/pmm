# Install PMM Server with Docker

Deploy PMM Server as a Docker container for a fast, flexible and isolated setup. 

While PMM Server runs independently, we highly recommend that you streamline [upgrades via the PMM user interface](../../../../pmm-upgrade/ui_upgrade.md) by installing [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) alongside PMM Server. 

With Watchtower installed, you can easily update PMM Server directly from the **Upgrade** page or by clicking the **Upgrade Now** button on the **Home** dashboard.

## Prerequisites
Before installation, ensure you have:

- Docker version 17.03 or higher
- CPU with `x86-64-v2` support
- [Sufficient system resources](../../../plan-pmm-installation/hardware_and_system.md) (recommended: 2+ CPU cores, 4+ GB RAM, 100+ GB disk space)

### Watchtower security requirements
To ensure a secure setup when using Watchtower:
 
 - Limit Watchtower' access to Docker network or localhost
 - Configure network to ensure only PMM Server is exposed externally
 - Secure Docker socket access for Watchtower
 - Place both Watchtower and PMM Server on the same Docker network

## Installation options

### Container setup summary

!!! info "Container setup at a glance"
    - **Pull the Docker image**: `docker pull percona/pmm-server:3`
    - **Choose storage**: Docker volumes (recommended) or host directory
    - **Run the container**: Using the appropriate `docker run` command
    - **Access the UI**: Navigate to `https://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` in your browser
    - **Log in**: Default credentials `admin` / `admin`

### Install PMM Server + Watchtower

You can install PMM Server with Watchtower using one of two methods:


=== "Easy-install script (Recommended for simplicity)"

    The [Easy-install script](../docker/easy-install.md) simplifies setup by including Watchtower commands, enabling a one-step installation of PMM with Watchtower. Run the following command:

      ```sh
      curl -fsSL https://www.percona.com/get/pmm | /bin/bash
      ```

=== "Manual installation (For customization)"
    For a more customizable setup, follow these steps:
    {.power-number}
    
    1.  Create a Docker network for PMM and Watchtower:
         ```sh
         docker network create pmm-network
         ``` 

    2. (Optional but recommended) Install Watchtower to enable PMM Server upgrades via the UI:

        - Create a user-defined token to secure Watchtower's HTTP API. You can use any value or generate a secure token using `openssl` or another method. Ensure the same token is used in both the Watchtower and PMM Server configurations:

            ```sh   
            openssl rand -hex 16
            # Example output:
            e09541c81e672bf0e48dbc72d4f92790
            ```
        
        - Install Watchtower using your token: 

            ```sh  
            docker run --detach \
            --restart always \
            --network=pmm-network \
            -e WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=your_token \
            -e WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_UPDATE=1 \
            --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
            --name watchtower \
            percona/watchtower:latest
            ```

    3. Run PMM Server with Docker based on your preferred data storage method:
         - [Run Docker with host directory](../docker/run_with_host_dir.md)
         - [Run Docker with volume](../docker/run_with_vol.md)

## Configuration options

### Storage configuration

You can choose either of two storage options offered by PMM Server:

| Option | Suitable for | Command |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| [Docker volumes](../docker/run_with_vol.md) (Recommended) | Production environments | `--volume pmm-data:/srv` |
| [Host directory](../docker/run_with_host_dir.md) | Development/testing | `--volume /path/on/host:/srv` |


### Environment variables

Configure PMM Server's behavior using environment variables:

```sh
docker run -e PMM_DATA_RETENTION=720h -e PMM_DEBUG=true percona/pmm-server:3
```

Common variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PMM_DATA_RETENTION` | `30d` | Duration to retain metrics data |
| `PMM_METRICS_RESOLUTION` | `1s` | Base metrics collection interval |
| `PMM_ENABLE_UPDATES` | `true` | Allow version checks and UI updates |
| `PMM_ENABLE_TELEMETRY` | `true` | Send usage statistics |

For a complete list, see the [environment variables](../docker/env_var.md).

## Access PMM Server

After installation:
{.power-number}

1. Access the PMM interface in your browser: `https://SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` (replace with your server's address)

2. Log in with default credentials: `admin` / `admin`. 

3. Change the default password on first login.

## Advanced configuration
After basic installation, you may want to customize your PMM Server setup:

### Security options
- Configure a [trusted SSL certificate](../../../../admin/security/ssl_encryption.md) to remove browser warnings.
- Disable the upgrade panel if needed:

    - **via Docker**:  add `-e PMM_ENABLE_UPDATES=false` to the `docker run` command (for the life of the container)
    - **via UI**: go to **PMM Configuration > Settings > Advanced Settings** and disable **Check for Updates** (can be turned back on by any admin in the UI)

- Enable HTTP (insecure, NOT recommended): add `--publish 80:8080` to the `docker run` command.

!!! info "Warning"
    PMM Client requires a secure (TLS-encrypted) connection and will only communicate with PMM Server over HTTPS.
