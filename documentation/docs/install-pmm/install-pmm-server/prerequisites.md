# Prerequisites for PMM Server

Before installing PMM Server, ensure your environment meets these requirements.

## Quick requirements checklist

✓ **Hardware**: CPU with SSE4.2 support, 4+ cores, 8+ GB RAM, 100+ GB storage  
✓ **OS**: Modern 64-bit Linux or container platform (Docker/Podman/Kubernetes)  
✓ **Network**: Ports 80/443 accessible to PMM Clients and users  
✓ **Container runtime**: Docker 17.03+ or Podman (for containerized deployments)  
✓ **Storage**: Persistent storage solution for data retention  

## System requirements

PMM Server requirements scale with the number of monitored nodes:

### Hardware specifications by deployment size

=== "Small (1-30 nodes)"

    - **CPU**: 4 cores with SSE4.2 support
    - **Memory**: 8 GB RAM
    - **Storage**: 100 GB
    - **Use cases**: Development, small businesses, initial deployments

=== "Medium (31-200 nodes)"

    - **CPU**: 8-16 cores with SSE4.2 support
    - **Memory**: 16-32 GB RAM
    - **Storage**: 200+ GB
    - **Use cases**: Production environments, mid-sized companies

=== "Large (200+ nodes)"

    - **CPU**: 16+ cores with SSE4.2 support
    - **Memory**: 32+ GB RAM
    - **Storage**: 500+ GB
    - **Use cases**: Large enterprises, mission-critical database fleets

For detailed sizing calculations, see [Hardware and system requirements](../plan-pmm-installation/hardware_and_system.md).

### Architecture requirements

- **CPU**: Must support SSE4.2 instruction set (required for Query Analytics)
- **x86_64**: Native support for optimal performance
- **ARM64**: Supported via Docker emulation using `--platform linux/amd64`

## Storage planning

PMM Server stores metrics data, requiring persistent storage:

- **Storage type**: Use persistent volumes (Docker volumes, cloud storage or host directories)
- **Capacity planning**: `nodes × retention_period_in_weeks × 1 GB`
- **Quick estimate**: `number_of_nodes × 4 GB` for default 30-day retention
- **Performance**: SSD recommended for better I/O performance

## Network connectivity

PMM Server requires these network connections:

| Connection | Port | Purpose | Required |
|------------|------|---------|----------|
| Users > PMM Server | 443 (HTTPS) | Web interface access | Essential |
| Users > PMM Server | 80 (HTTP) | Web interface (insecure) | Optional |
| PMM Clients > PMM Server | 443/80 | Metrics reporting | Essential |
| PMM Server > Internet | 443 | Updates, telemetry | Optional |

For complete port specifications, see [Network and firewall requirements](../plan-pmm-installation/network_and_firewall.md).

## Deployment-specific prerequisites

Choose your deployment method and ensure it meets these specific requirements:

=== ":simple-docker: Docker"
    **Version requirements:**
    
    - Docker version 17.03 or higher
    - CPU with `x86-64-v2` support
    
    **System resources:**

    - Recommended: 2+ CPU cores, 4+ GB RAM, 100+ GB disk space
    
    **Optional but recommended:**

    - Watchtower for UI-based updates
    - Docker Compose for multi-container setups
    
    **Security considerations for Watchtower:**

    - Limit Watchtower's access to Docker network or localhost
    - Configure network to ensure only PMM Server is exposed externally
    - Secure Docker socket access for Watchtower
    - Place both Watchtower and PMM Server on the same Docker network

=== ":simple-podman: Podman"
    **Version requirements:**

    - Recent Podman version with systemd support
    - Rootless Podman configuration
    
    **System configuration:**

    - Allow non-root users to bind to privileged ports (port 443)
    - Podman socket enabled for Watchtower integration
    - systemd user services enabled
    
    **Required setup commands:**

    ```sh
    # Configure privileged port access
    echo "net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=443" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-pmm.conf
    sudo sysctl -p /etc/sysctl.d/99-pmm.conf
    
    # Enable Podman socket
    systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
    ```
    
    **Security advantages:**

    - Enhanced security isolation with rootless containers
    - Better systemd integration for service management
    - Fine-grained permission control

=== ":simple-kubernetes: Kubernetes"
    **Cluster requirements:**

    - Kubernetes 1.19+ with supported version
    - kubectl configured to communicate with your cluster
    
    **Helm requirements:**

    - Helm v3 installed and configured
    - Access to Percona Helm charts repository
    
    **Storage requirements:**

    - Storage driver with snapshot support (for backups)
    - Dynamic provisioning capability
    - Persistent Volume support
    
    **Production considerations:**

    - Separate PMM Server from monitored systems
    - High availability configuration for continuous monitoring
    - Workload separation through node configurations and affinity rules

=== ":material-harddisk: Virtual Appliance (OVA)"
    **Hypervisor compatibility:**

    - VMware ESXi 6.0+, Workstation 12.0+, Fusion 10.0+
    - VirtualBox 6.0+
    
    **VM specifications (default):**

    - OS: Oracle Linux 9.3
    - CPU: 1 (adjustable after deployment)
    - Memory: 4096 MB (adjustable after deployment)
    - Disk 1: 40 GB (system)
    - Disk 2: 400 GB (data)
    
    **Network access:**

    - Outbound internet access for updates (optional)
    - Access to monitored database instances
    - Access from client browsers to PMM web interface
    
    **Security note:**

    - Default users: `admin/admin` and `root/percona`
    - **Must change default passwords immediately after installation**

## Security considerations

### SSL/TLS certificates

- **Self-signed**: PMM Server generates these automatically
- **Custom certificates**: Prepare SSL certificates for production deployments
- **Certificate authority**: Consider using trusted CA certificates for public access

### Access control

- **Admin credentials**: Plan initial admin username/password strategy
- **Default passwords**: Change immediately (especially for OVA deployment)
- **User management**: Consider integration with existing authentication systems
- **Network security**: Plan firewall rules and network segmentation

### Data protection

- **Backup strategy**: Plan for PMM Server data backup and recovery
- **Encryption**: Consider encryption for data at rest and in transit
- **Compliance**: Ensure deployment meets organizational security requirements
