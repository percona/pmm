# Install PMM Server with Docker container

This section explains how to install PMM Server as a Docker container. To enable PMM Server upgrades via the **Upgrade page** and the **Upgrade Now** button on the **Home** dashboard, you must configure Watchtower during the PMM Server installation.

Watchtower is a container-updating tool that enables [PMM Server upgrades](../../../../pmm-upgrade/ui_upgrade.md) through the UI. Without it, the **Upgrade** page and **Upgrade Now** button will not be available.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the installation:

* Install Docker version 17.03 or higher
* Ensure your CPU supports `x86-64-v2`
* For manual installation, consider these Watchtower security requirements:
  - Restrict Watchtower access to Docker network or localhost
  - Configure network to expose only PMM Server externally
  - Secure Docker socket access for Watchtower
  - Place both Watchtower and PMM Server on the same network

## Installation options

You can install PMM Server with Watchtower in two ways:


=== "Easy-install script"

    The [Easy-install script](../docker/easy-install.md) simplifies setup by including Watchtower commands, enabling a one-step installation of PMM with Watchtower. Run the following command:

      ```sh
      curl -fsSL https://www.percona.com/get/pmm | /bin/bash
      ```

=== "Manual installation"

    For a more customizable setup, follow these steps:
    {.power-number}

    1.  Create a Docker network for PMM and Watchtower:
         ```sh
         docker network create pmm-network
         ```

    2. Install Watchtower using the command below. The `your_token` value must match the `WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN` value used in your PMM Server container configuration:

         ```sh
         docker run --detach \
         --restart always \
         --network=<your_network> \
         -e WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_TOKEN=your_token \
         -e WATCHTOWER_HTTP_API_UPDATE=1 \
         --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
         --name watchtower \
         percona/watchtower:latest
         ```

    3. Run PMM Server with Docker based on your preferred data storage method:
         - [Run Docker with host directory](../docker/run_with_host_dir.md)
         - [Run Docker with volume](../docker/run_with_vol.md)


## Run Docker container

??? info "Summary"

    !!! summary alert alert-info ""
        - Pull the Docker image.
        - Choose how you want to store data.
        - Run the image.
        - Open the PMM UI in a browser.

??? info "Key points"

    - To disable the Home Dashboard **PMM Upgrade** panel you can either add `-e PMM_ENABLE_UPDATES=false` to the `docker run` command (for the life of the container) or navigate to _PMM --> PMM Settings --> Advanced Settings_ and disable "Check for Updates" (can be turned back on by any admin in the UI).

    - Eliminate browser certificate warnings by configuring a [trusted certificate](../../../../how-to/secure.html#ssl-encryption).

    - You can optionally enable an (insecure) HTTP connection by adding `--publish 80:8080` to the `docker run` command. However, running PMM insecure is not recommended. You should also note that PMM Client *requires* TLS to communicate with the server, only working on a secure port.
