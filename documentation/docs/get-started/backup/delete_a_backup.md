# Delete a backup

You can only delete backup artifacts stored on Amazon S3-compatible. Local backups must be removed manually.

To delete a backup:

1. Go to  <i class="uil uil-history"></i> **Backup > All Backups** and find the row with the backup you want to delete.
2. Click the arrow in the **Actions** column to check all the information for the backup, then click {{icon.ellipsisv}} **Delete backup**.
3. In the **Delete backup artifact** dialog box, enable **Delete from storage** if you also want to delete the actual backup content besides just the backup register.
4. Click **Delete**.
