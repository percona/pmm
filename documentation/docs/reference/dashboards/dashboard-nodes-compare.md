This dashboard lets you compare a wide range of parameters. Parameters of the same type are shown side by side for all servers, grouped into the following sections:

- System Information
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk Partitions
- Disk Performance
- Network

The **System Information** section shows the **System Info** summary of each server, as well as **System Uptime**, **CPU Cores**, **RAM**, **Saturation Metrics**, and **Load Average** gauges.

The **CPU** section offers the **CPU Usage**, **Interrupts**, and **Context Switches** metrics.

In the **Memory** section, you can find the **Memory Usage**, **Swap Usage**, and **Swap Activity** metrics.

The **Disk Partitions** section encapsulates two metrics, **Mountpoint Usage** and **Free Space**.

The **Disk Performance** section contains the **I/O Activity**, **Disk Operations**, **Disk Bandwidth**, **Disk IO Utilization**, **Disk Latency**, and **Disk Load** metrics.

Finally, **Network** section shows **Network Traffic**, and **Network Utilization Hourly** metrics.
