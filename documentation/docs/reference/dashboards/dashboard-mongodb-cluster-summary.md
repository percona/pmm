![!image](../../images/PMM_MongoDB_Cluster_Summary.jpg)

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of your MongoDB sharded cluster's performance, health, and resource utilization. It displays essential data for individual nodes organized by component type (shards, config servers, and mongos routers), offering insights into:

- shard distribution and balance
- query operations and performance
- resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- replication status across the cluster
- component-specific health indicators

For MongoS (Router) specific monitoring, see the [MongoDB Router Summary](dashboard-mongodb-router-summary.md) dashboard.

## Overview 

### Feature Compatibility Version

Displays the Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) currently active in your MongoDB deployment. The FCV controls which database features are available and affects data file format compatibility between MongoDB versions.

This panel helps you confirm that your cluster is running the expected FCVâ€”especially useful after upgrades, when the FCV may lag behind the MongoDB binary version.

Monitoring FCV is important when planning upgrades or downgrades, as setting a newer FCV can enable advanced features but may prevent rolling back to older MongoDB versions.

### QPS of Services in Shard

Displays the Queries Per Second (QPS) for each shard and the config server replica set in your MongoDB cluster. It shows the rate of operations (excluding commands) for each component, helping you quickly assess the query load distribution across your sharded environment.

The chart uses the most recent non-null value and updates based on your selected time interval. This visualization allows you to easily identify which shards are handling the most queries and spot any potential load imbalances. 

### Shards

Reports the number of shards in your MongoDB cluster. The number of shards indicates how your data is distributed across the cluster, which is crucial for understanding your database's scalability and performance.

A shard contains a subset of sharded data for a sharded cluster. Together, the cluster's shards hold the entire data set for the cluster.

### Mongos

Number of mongos routers registered as part of the cluster.

### Draining Shards

Displays a single number representing the current count of shards that are in the process of being drained from your MongoDB cluster.

When you run `removeShard`, MongoDB drains the shard by using the balancer to move the shard's chunks to other shards in the cluster. Once the shard is drained, MongoDB removes the shard from the cluster. The number shown here indicates how many shards are currently undergoing this draining process.

### DBs

Shows the number of user-created databases in your MongoDB sharded cluster. It provides a quick view of how many databases your cluster is managing, updating every 5 minutes.

This simple count helps you track database growth and understand the scale of your MongoDB deployment at a glance.

### Sharded Collections

Provides a quick view of how many collections in your MongoDB cluster are sharded. This is an important metric for understanding the scale and distribution of your data across the sharded cluster. 

A higher number indicates more collections are distributed across multiple shards, which can improve performance for large datasets.
However, it also implies more complex data management.

### Balancer Enabled

Background process that monitors the number of chunks on each shard and whether the MongoDB Balancer is currently enabled in your sharded cluster.

The balancer is crucial for maintaining an even distribution of chunks across shards, so knowing its status is important for cluster health and performance.

A **YES** indicates that the balancer is active and working to keep your data evenly distributed, while a **NO** might indicate a manual override or a potential issue that needs investigation.

### Total amount of Chunks

Provides a quick view of the total number of chunks in your sharded MongoDB cluster to give you an idea of how your data is distributed across the cluster.

A high number of chunks could indicate a well-distributed dataset, while a sudden increase might suggest increased data volume or changes in your sharding strategy.

### Last Election

Provides a quick view of how long it has been since the last election in your MongoDB replica set.

Elections occur when a new primary node needs to be chosen, which can happen during normal operations (like planned maintenance) or due to issues (like a primary node failure).

A very recent election might indicate a recent change or issue in your cluster that warrants investigation, while a long time since the last election suggests stability in the primary node assignment.

### Chunks distribution
