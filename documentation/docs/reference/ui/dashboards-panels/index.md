The interface is a collection of web pages called dashboards.

Dashboards are grouped into folders. You can customize these, by renaming them or creating new ones.

The area inside dashboards is populated by panels. Some are in collapsible panel groups. A panel can show a value, a graph, a chart, or a visual representation of a set.
