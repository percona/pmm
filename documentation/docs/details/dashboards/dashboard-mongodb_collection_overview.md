# MongoDB Collections Overview

This realtime dashboard contains panels of data about the Hottest Collections in the MongoDB database.

The Instance level includes two panels, one for the **Hottest Collections by Read (Total)** and the **Hottest Collections by Write (total)**.

The next panel displays data at the **Database Level**, where you can view MongoDB metrics such as **Commands**, **Inserts**, **Updates**, **Removes**, and **Getmore**.

The last panel shows the number of operations in the chosen database.
