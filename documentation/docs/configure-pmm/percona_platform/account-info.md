# Check Percona Portal account information

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Percona Platform deprecation"
    
    **Percona Platform is deprecated as of PMM 3.5.0 and will be discontinued with PMM 3.7.0 (March 2026).**
    
    All advisors and alert templates are now built directly into PMM as free, offline features. Platform connectivity, Percona Account sign-in, and account information features (Entitlements and Support tickets) in PMM will be removed. 
    
    Make sure to switch to [local PMM authentication](../../reference/ui/log_in.md) and [upgrade to 3.5.0+](../../pmm-upgrade/index.md).
    
    **Need help?** Contact [Percona Support](https://www.percona.com/services/support) for migration assistance.
