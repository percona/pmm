!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    PMM upgrade **fails** for versions prior to 2.33.0. Although there is a [workaround](2.33.0.md#known-issues), we highly recommend using the latest version of PMM. This ensures that you have access to the latest PMM features and that your environment runs on the latest version of the underlying components with all the bug fixes in place.


## Release Highlights


### Offline metric collection

Starting with PMM 2.33.0, we have introduced a new solution to prevent data collection interruption in PMM, via offline metric collection. A network outage between the PMM server and the client prevented metrics from being collected. As a result, the historical data was lost, which can be useful when analyzing trends, diagnosing problems, or investigating issues from a previous period.

In order to address the problem mentioned above, for the PMM server and PMM client running version 2.33.0, in case of a brief outage or network issue, metrics are stored on the monitored instance until the PMM server is up and running. At this point, the metrics will be pushed to the server. It only applies to PMM Clients that run in push mode, which is the default mode. The same holds when a brief network outage occurs on the client side.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
    The client node can currently store only 1 GB of offline data. So, for example, if your instance is down for three days, all the data will not be retrieved.

With the implementation of the above feature, we have taken the first step toward PMM HA. Furthermore, we are happy to provide a roadmap for PMM HA implementation, a much-anticipated solution by our users. In the event of a failover, your PMM setup will experience near-zero downtime, and monitoring will continue with the offline metric collection.

To ensure a smooth rollout, PMM HA will be introduced in phases, in line with your requirements and feedback.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    PMM HA will be rolled out in three stages. Stage one of PMM HA is the implementation to prevent data collection interruption with VictoriaMetrics integration for short outages **included** as part of **PMM 2.33.0**. HA stages two and three will be rolled out next year.

The following features/use cases will be covered as part of the various stages of PMM HA:


|**Stages of PMM HA**              | **Solutions Provided**          |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
|**Stage one (included in PMM 2.33.0)**             |As an initial step towards preventing data collection interruption, we have developed the following:<br><br>**Prevent data collection interruption with VM integration for short outages**|
|**Stage two (will be rolled out in 2023)**         |As part of PMM HA stage two, we plan to implement the following:<br><br>**HA data sources**<br>As part of stage two we will let the users use external data sources, thereby decreasing dependency on the file system.
|**Stage three (will be rolled out in 2023)**        |As part of PMM HA stage three, we plan to implement the following:<br><br>**Clusterized HA**<br>Clustered PMM will be the focus of stage three. Detailed information will be included in the upcoming release notes.



### Guided tour of Percona Alerting


Following the recent improvements to PMM Alerting, we have added a short tutorial to help you explore our streamlined alerting system based on Grafana.
The in-app tutorial automatically pops up when you first open the **Alerting** page to help you uncover the fundamentals of Percona Alerting.


### Restore MongoDB backups easier

Building on the significant improvements for MongoDB Backup Management introduced in the previous release. We are now simplifying the process for restoring physical MongoDB backups.
Starting with this release, you can restore physical backups straight from the UI, and PMM will handle the process end-to-end. Prior to this, you would require to perform additional manual steps to restart your MongoDB database service so that your applications could make use of the restored data.

### Components Upgrade

- VictoriaMetrics has been upgraded from 1.77.1 to 1.82.1.
- As part of PMM 2.33.0, Grafana has been updated to 9.2.5, which fixes some critical vulnerabilities. For more information, see [Grafana 9.2.5](https://grafana.com/blog/2022/11/08/security-release-new-versions-of-grafana-with-critical-and-moderate-fixes-for-cve-2022-39328-cve-2022-39307-and-cve-2022-39306/)


## New Features

- [PMM-10889](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10889) - Starting with PMM2.33.0, while using the pmm-admin CLI command, you do not have to know the entire command. Just type the initial command and press Tab. The rest of the command will be autocompleted.

    Depending on the shell you are using, add the following to your shells .rc file for autocomplete to work:

    ```sh
    source <(pmm-admin completion -c <your shell>)
    E.g. source <(pmm-admin completion -c bash)
    ```

- [PMM-10955](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10955): [Backup Management]: After restoring a backup, you can now check the time when the restore was finalized. For PITR backups, you can also check the time to which the restore was performed.
   This information is available on the tab **Backup > Restores** page, in the new **Finished at** column, and in the **PITR timestamp** field under the **Actions** menu.

## Improvements

- [PMM-7000](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7000): [HA]: Staring with PMM 2.33.0, if the PMM Server goes down, metrics will be buffered on the monitored instance until PMM Server goes back online, which is when metrics will get pushed to the PMM Server. 

- [PMM-10901](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10901): [Documentation]: To enable the users to use High Availability easily, we have added exclusive documentation for HA.

- [PMM-8516](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8516): [Backup Management]:  When creating a backup, the Vendor field was not automatically populated in the Back-up on demand dialog. This issue is now fixed.

- [PMM-10903](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10903): [DBaaS]: To simplify DBaas, you no longer have to manually enter the Public Address on the **PMM Settings > Advanced Settings** page. With DBaaS enabled, PMM will automatically detect and populate the **Public Address**.


- [PMM-11085](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11085): [Backup Management]: We've removed the **Create backup** option under **All backups** page > **Actions** menu because this option can only create on-demand backups. You can continue to create both on-demand and scheduled backups using the **Create backup** button on this page. 

- [PMM-10881](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10881): [CVE]: As part of PMM 2.33.0, Grafana was updated to 9.2.5, which fixes some critical vulnerabilities.

This was causing `supervisord` to kill `pmm-update-checker`, the component responsible for verifying if a newer version of the PMM Server is available for upgrade. This issue has been resolved now.

- [PMM-10683](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10683): [DBaaS]: While registering a K8s cluster on the **Manage Components Versions** modal, the versions were not getting unchecked. The issue has now been resolved.

## Known issues

- [PMM-11126](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11126): **PMM server cannot be upgraded to version 2.32.0**

    A bug in PMM Server ansible scripts caused PMM to upgrade Nginx's dependencies without updating Nginx itself. Due to this, PMM throws an error while upgrading and cannot upgrade to a newer version.


    !!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
        This issue has been resolved for PMM version 2.33.0. However, the issue persists on all the versions prior to 2.33.0.


    **Solution**

    While PMM is being upgraded, log in to the PMM server and run the following command:

    ```sh
    sed -i 's/- nginx/- nginx*/' /usr/share/pmm-update/ansible/playbook/tasks/update.yml
    ```


-  [PMM-10858](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10858): **PMM server does not show latest versions available with the instances created with AWS**

    For PMM versions prior to 2.33.0, in specific environments, including AWS, some EPEL repository mirrors did not respond within the time limit defined by pmm-update (currently set to 30 seconds). It was causing supervisord to kill pmm-update-checker, which determines if a newer PMM Server is available for upgrade.

    **Solution**

    Log in to the PMM Server and run the following command as a root user:

    ```
    $ yum-config-manager --setopt=epel.timeout=1 --save
    ```
