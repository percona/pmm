Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
    PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation — please don’t try to upgrade your existing PMM 1 environment.

## Improvements and new features

- [PMM-5321](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5321): The optimization of the Query Analytics parser code for PostgreSQL queries allowed us to reduce the memory resources consumption by 1-5%, and the parsing time of an individual query by 30 to 40%
- [PMM-5184](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5184): The `pmm-admin summary` command have gained a new `--skip-server` flag which makes it operating in a local-only mode, creating summary file without contacting the PMM Server

## Fixed bugs

- [PMM-5340](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5340): The Scraping Time Drift graph on the Prometheus dashboard was showing wrong values because the actual metrics resolution wasn’t taken into account
- [PMM-5060](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5060): Query Analytics Dashboard did not show the row with the last query of the first page, if the number of queries to display was 11
