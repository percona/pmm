Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

1. Ability to monitor SSL-enabled MongoDB

    Allows PMM administrators to set up configured SSL certificate “keys” to authenticate the connection to PMM, specifically for setting up MongoDB. This is a critical security requirement especially in large enterprise infrastructure environments.

2. Technical Previews

    !!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
        We do not recommend the use of technical preview features in enterprise or production environments until the functionality is released as general availability (GA). While in Technical Preview status, these features are not supported by Percona Support SLA, except by Product/Engineering on a best-efforts basis.

    1. Integrated Alerting MVP

        A new feature in PMM to set up parameters and revive alerts about the Services and Nodes monitored by PMM.

        Read more [on our blog](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/18/percona-monitoring-and-management-introduces-integrated-alerting-in-v2-13-via-a-technical-preview/) and in our [documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/get-started/alerting.html).

    2. Node Summary/Nodes Overview dashboards: Show External services on dashboards

        Improves the user experience for adding and viewing external services on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM. External services means any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus exporter, for example, non-Percona supported databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization’s external application.

    3. DBaaS Preview phase 1.0

        We are also releasing the first preview of DBaaS functionality; when combined with a compatible Kubernetes environment and Percona Operators, you can create Percona XtraDB or MongoDB clusters with just a few clicks. (Read more about [configuration](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/dbaas.html) and [usage](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/get-started/platform/dbaas.html).)
