## Release Highlights

- Backup Management can now be enabled from the UI. Go to {{icon.configuration}} *Configuration* → <i class="uil uil-setting"></i> *Settings* → *Advanced Settings*, and you will see it in the *Technical Preview* section. We also added support for MongoDB services on-demand backup and restore. For now, it only supports ReplicaSet on S3-compatible storage.

- Dashboards improvements

    - There are several community-driven improvements to ProxySQL data collection, with new dashboards to expose such metrics like: *Queries Latency histograms* and `SHUNNED_REPLICATION_LAG` state.

    - Fixes for Amazon Aurora service detection on [the dashboard](https://pmmdemo.percona.com/graph/d/mysql-amazonaurora/mysql-amazon-aurora-details?var-service_name=rds-aurora57-instance-1), MongoDB ReplicaSet Summary, and other MongoDB memory-related panels.

- Improvements to DBaaS secrets by generating strong passwords for operators. This is an improvement to the Automated Operator Installation released in [PMM 2.18](2.18.0.md), which will greatly enhance security.
