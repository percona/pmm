## Release summary

## Release highlights

### MongoDB dashboard improvements

We've made several enhancements to improve MongoDB monitoring:

- Renamed **Query Execution Times** panel to **Operation Latencies** in **Router Summary**, **Sharded Cluster Summary**, and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards for clarity
- Fixed duplicate service counts in MongoDB dashboards and node filtering issues in **Replica Set Summary**, **Cluster Summary**, and **Router Summary** dashboards
- Added idle connections metric to the **Connections** panel in **Cluster Summary** and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards to help identify performance issues:

### MySQL dashboard improvements

Removed the **MySQL Query Response Time Details** dashboard as it only functioned with MySQL 5.7 (now End of Life) and is not compatible with MySQL 8.0+.


## Components upgrade


## Improvements
- [PMM-14108](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14108): Added idle connections metric to the **Connections** panel available in **MongoDB Cluster Summary** and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards. Idle connections are now displayed alongside Available and Current connections to help identify potential performance issues.

- [PMM-13782](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13782): Removed the **MySQL Query Response Time Details** dashboard. This dashboard only worked with MySQL 5.7 and earlier when the Query Response Time plugin was enabled. Since MySQL 5.7 has reached End-of-Life and the plugin is not compatible with MySQL 8.0+, the dashboard has been removed. For MySQL 8.0+ instances, use [Query Analytics (QAN) with Performance Schema](.../../../install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mysql/mysql.md#query-response-time-percona-server-57--mariadb-only) as the query source to monitor query performance and response times.
- [PMM-14107](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14107): Renamed the **Query Execution Times** panel to **Operation Latencies** in **MongoDB Router Summary**, **Sharded Cluster Summary**, and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards to better reflect the actual metrics being displayed.
## Fixed issues
- [PMM-14022](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14022):  Fixed duplicate service counts in MongoDB dashboards and the MongoDB down alert rule on the **Alert rules** page caused by high-resolution and low-resolution exporter jobs being counted separately.
- [PMM-14106](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14106): Fixed **MongoDB Command Operations** and **Collection Details** panels in **Replica Set Summary**, **Cluster Summary**, and **Router Summary** dashboards to correctly apply the node filter selection. The panels now display data only for the selected node instead of always showing all nodes.
