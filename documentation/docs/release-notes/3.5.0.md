## Release summary

## Release highlights

### Support for partial certificates for remote MySQL monitoring

PMM now supports partial TLS certificates when adding remote MySQL instances, enabling seamless monitoring of cloud-based MySQL services such as Azure MySQL Flexible Server and Google Cloud SQL that require single certificate file authentication.

This enables you to:

- monitor Azure MySQL Flexible Server instances using only the downloaded `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem` certificate
- monitor Google Cloud SQL (MySQL) instances with single certificate files
- configure TLS connections using only the CA certificate, without requiring client certificate and key files

Similar support for PostgreSQL will be available in a future release.

For instructions on adding MySQL instances with TLS certificates, see [Connect MySQL databases to PMM](../install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mysql/mysql.html).
