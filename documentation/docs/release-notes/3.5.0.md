## Release summary

## Release highlights

### Support for partial certificates for remote MySQL monitoring
PMM now supports adding remote MySQL instances using partial TLS configurations. You can now configure TLS connections using only the CA certificate, without requiring client certificate and key files. 

This enables you to:

- monitor Azure MySQL Flexible Server instances using only the downloaded `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem` certificate
- monitor Google Cloud SQL (MySQL) instances with single certificate files
- configure TLS connections using only the CA certificate, without requiring separate client certificate and key files

For instructions, see [Connect MySQL databases to PMM](../install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mysql/mysql.md).

!!! note
    Similar support for PostgreSQL will be available in a future release.
