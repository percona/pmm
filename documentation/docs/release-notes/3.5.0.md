## Release summary

## Release highlights

### Free built-in advisors and alert templates replace Percona Platform

We're making Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) more powerful and self-sufficient. 

As we prepare for the discontinuation of Percona Platform services in March 2026, we've migrated all database advisors, checks, and alert templates directly into PMM. They are now included by default, work completely offline and require no subscription. 

This transition delivers a simpler PMM that runs all checks and alerts locally, without relying on internet access or external dependencies. Here’s what to expect from this change:

- **PMM 3.5.0+:** Advisors and alert templates are now built-in with every installation—completely free, with no subscription required. All advisors (previously across Basic, Standard, and Premium tiers) work seamlessly with no service interruption or changes to your workflow.

- **PMM 3.0.0 - 3.4.x:** Internet-connected PMM instances will continue receiving free advisors and templates from the Platform until its discontinuation in PMM 3.7.0. Once the Platform shuts down, you'll be prompted to upgrade to 3.5.0+ for continued access to advisors and templates. 

- **PMM 2.x:** PMM 2 is discontinued and Platform connectivity for advisors and templates will cease after its official End Of Life. To continue using advisors and alert templates, [upgrade using the recommended path](../pmm-upgrade/migrating_from_pmm_2.md).

- **Percona Account authentication:** With the Platform's discontinuation, the ability to sign into PMM using Percona Account credentials will no longer be available. [Migrate to a supported authentication method](../admin/manage-users/edit_users.md#migrate-from-percona-account-authentication-deprecated) before then to maintain access. PMM supports all authentication methods available in Grafana, including basic auth, LDAP, OAuth, SAML, and more.

### MongoDB dashboard improvements

We've made several enhancements to improve MongoDB monitoring:

- Renamed **Query Execution Times** panel to **Operation Latencies** in **Router Summary**, **Sharded Cluster Summary**, and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards for clarity
- Fixed duplicate service counts in MongoDB dashboards and node filtering issues in **Replica Set Summary**, **Cluster Summary**, and **Router Summary** dashboards
- Added idle connections metric to the **Connections** panel in **Cluster Summary** and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards to help identify performance issues:

### Support for partial certificates for remote MySQL monitoring
PMM now supports adding remote MySQL instances using partial TLS configurations. You can now configure TLS connections using only the CA certificate, without requiring client certificate and key files. 

This enables you to:

- monitor Azure MySQL Flexible Server instances using only the downloaded `DigiCertGlobalRootCA.crt.pem` certificate
- monitor Google Cloud SQL (MySQL) instances with single certificate files
- configure TLS connections using only the CA certificate, without requiring separate client certificate and key files

For instructions, see [Connect MySQL databases to PMM](../install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mysql/mysql.md).

!!! note
    Similar support for PostgreSQL will be available in a future release.
    
## Components upgrade

## Improvements
- [PMM-14108](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14108): Added idle connections metric to the **Connections** panel available in **MongoDB Cluster Summary** and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards. Idle connections are now displayed alongside Available and Current connections to help identify potential performance issues.
- [PMM-14107](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14107): Renamed the **Query Execution Times** panel to **Operation Latencies** in **MongoDB Router Summary**, **Sharded Cluster Summary**, and **Replica Set Summary** dashboards to better reflect the actual metrics being displayed.
## Fixed issues
- [PMM-14022](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14022):  Fixed duplicate service counts in MongoDB dashboards and the MongoDB down alert rule on the **Alert rules** page caused by high-resolution and low-resolution exporter jobs being counted separately.
- [PMM-14106](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14106): Fixed **MongoDB Command Operations** and **Collection Details** panels in **Replica Set Summary**, **Cluster Summary**, and **Router Summary** dashboards to correctly apply the node filter selection. The panels now display data only for the selected node instead of always showing all nodes.
