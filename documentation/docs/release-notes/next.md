## 📋 Release summary

## ✨ Release highlights

## 🔒 Security updates

## 📈 Improvements

- [PMM-15805](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15805): The **Services** tab on **MongoDB > Operations > Fleet** now shows why a service is failing. The **Collected** column shows the reason, for example **Database unreachable**, and the service details show the full error, what to do about it, and a link to the scan that failed. A **Down** service whose `mongod` or `mongos` wasn't running at its last scan shows **not running**. The **Clusters** tab now warns when scan results can't be read. For details, see [Operations for MongoDB](../use/mongodb-operations.md#scans).

## ✅ Fixed issues

- [PMM-15168](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15168): PMM Server reads its database passwords, the admin password and Grafana's secret key from files. It no longer writes them into its program configuration files, and it removes the environment variables it reads them from before it starts its services. You can supply them as files, for example from a secrets manager. For details, see [Supply credentials as files](../admin/security/credentials_as_files.md).
