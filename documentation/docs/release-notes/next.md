## 📈 Improvements

- [PMM-15239](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15239): The **Alert Status** page now groups alert severities into four bands: **Critical**, **Error**, **Warning** and **Info**. Each band has its own icon and label, so you can tell severities apart without relying on color. The **Severity** filter and sort work by band, and the alert details show the original level, for example **Reported as Emergency**. Alert labels stay the same. For how levels map to bands, see [Alert rules](../alert/alert_rules.md).
- [PMM-15805](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15805): The **Services** tab on **MongoDB > Operations > Fleet** now shows why a service is failing. The **Collected** column shows the reason, for example **Database unreachable**, and the service details show the full error, what to do about it, and a link to the scan that failed. A **Down** service whose `mongod` or `mongos` wasn't running at its last scan shows **not running**. The **Clusters** tab now warns when scan results can't be read. For details, see [Operations for MongoDB](../use/mongodb-operations.md#scans).

## ✅ Fixed issues

- [PMM-15654](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15654): Fixed the [MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) dashboard hiding clusters added without `--environment` when **Environment** is set to **All** and another MongoDB service has an environment set. These clusters now appear under **All**.

- [PMM-15776](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-15776): Fixed misleading help on **MongoDB > Operations > Settings**. **Connect to MongoDB** now says that scans log in with the `.mongodb_uri` file in the home directory of the user pmm-agent runs as, not with the monitoring credentials PMM holds. The **Automatic node scans** setting is removed: turning it off also blocked **Scan** and **Scan all** on the **Nodes** page, and PMM turned it back on at every restart. For details, see [Operations for MongoDB](../use/mongodb-operations.md#provide-mongodb-credentials-for-scans).

- [PMM-7](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-7): Updated the Grafana ClickHouse data source plugin to v4.23.4, built with Go 1.27.3. This fixes the high-severity Go vulnerabilities that image scanners reported in v4.21.3, including [CVE-2026-78669](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2026-78669) and the standard library findings listed in the [PMM 3.10.0 release notes](3.10.0.md#go-standard-library-vulnerabilities-in-the-clickhouse-data-source).
