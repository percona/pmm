| **Installation:** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](https://www.percona.com/software/pmm/quickstart) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

## Release Highlights

### Various UX enhancements to Backup Management

 With this release, we are updating the Backup and Restore functionality with key usability enhancements, including:

- Filtering on services at backup creation time. This makes it considerably easier to find the right service for a backup when working with multiple servers.
- Automatic redirection to the **Restores** page after initiating a restore. From here you can immediately monitor the restore process, and see the restore history for your PMM instance.
- Added information about the type of storage for the backup artifacts on the  **All backups** page. This helps you get a more comprehensive overview of your current backups.
- Design and usability improvements on the **Create Backup** and **All Backups** page to increase consistency with other PMM UI controls.

### DBaaS migration

Starting with PMM 2.34.0, PMM installs and manages operators using [Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://olm.operatorframework.io/) (OLM) and database clusters using `dbaas-operator`. Nonetheless, these changes are backward incompatible, and you must perform these additional steps:

1. Force unregister the Kubernetes cluster from PMM (select Ignore errors checkbox) and register it back. PMM will install OLM and `dbaas-catalog` to manage the lifecycle of PXC, PSMDB, and DBaaS operators.
2. Create a database cluster for each cluster you have created in PMM. You can use the [script](https://github.com/percona/pmm/blob/main/migrate-dbaas.py) to do it automatically during the maintenance window. Migration scripts use the default configuration to connect to Kubernetes clusters and run migrations against them.



### New components

We have a newly added component, `VMProxy` starting with PMM 2.34.0. `VMProxy` is a stateless reverse proxy that proxies requests to VictoriaMetrics and optionally adds `extra_filters` query based on the provided configuration.

## New Features

[PMM-11031](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11031) - To enhance the DBaaS experience, the UI has been extended to include the following:

  - Network and Security - DBaaS users can set a source range from which they can connect to their DB clusters with the **Expose** field. You can modify the exposure level using the **Source Range** field. Additionally, the **Source Range** field allows you to choose the network from which you can connect.
  - Configuring the database engine - Copy-paste the config string into the **Configuration** text box to configure the database engine.
  - Configuring storage classes - You can choose from the available classes.


## Improvements

- [PMM-11024](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11024) - [DBaaS]: Move from dbaas-controller to dbaas-operator
- [PMM-10873](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10873) - [DBaaS]: Create DB Cluster: We have modified the UI to include a separate window rather than a popup so that creating a DB cluster is easier.
- [PMM-11132](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11132) - [DBaaS]: During K8s cluster registration, a new state called **Provisioning** is added. **Provisioning** is the default state, and once that is completed, the state will change to **Active**.
- [PMM-11134](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11134) - [DBaaS]: Edit DB Cluster: We have modified the UI to include a separate window rather than a popup so that editing a DB cluster is easier.
- [PMM-9262 ](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9262)  - [Backups]: After starting a backup restore from the **All Backups** page, PMM now automatically redirects you to the **Restores** tab, where you can check the status of your new restore.
- [PMM-11086](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11086) - [Backups]: Improved design for the **On Demand** and **Schedule Backup** cards on the **Create Backup** page. In addition, the **Created** column on the **Restores** tab has been replaced with **Started at** and **Ended** columns to provide more insight into the restore process.
- [PMM-10924](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10924) - [Backups]: The **Location** column on the **All Backups** page has been enhanced to include information about the storage type used for the backup: Local or S3-compatible.
- [PMM-11171](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11171) - [Backups]: The **Service name** field on the **Create Backup** page is now searchable. This makes it easier to find the right service for a new backup when working with multiple servers. Just paste the name of the server you're looking for, or start typing to see the list of matching servers.
- [PMM-9079](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9079) - [Backups]: Added **Target Service** column under **Backup > Restores** to show the service to which a backup was restored.
- [PMM-10773](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10773) - [Alerting]: Added option to unsilence alerts from the **Actions** menu under **Alerting > Fired Alerts**.
- [PMM-11230](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11230) - [Alerting]: The **Fired alerts** page under **Alerting** now auto-refreshes more frequently to ensure that any new alerts are displayed in real-time.
- [PMM-11255](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11255) - [Alerting]: PMM no longer transfers the name of the current alert rule when switching from **Percona templated alert** to **Grafana managed alert**.
- [PMM-11090](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11090) - The Logs feature has been moved from the `dbaas-controller` to PMM, providing users with the ability to see the events for each pod and the logs for every container properly populated within PMM.
- [PMM-11179](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11179) - Starting with PMM 2.34.0, we support push metrics mode while updating labels.
- [PMM-11189](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11189) - Starting With PMM 2.34.0, we have implemented vmproxy integration and frontend API changes.
- [PMM-10705](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10705) - [DBaaS]: As of PMM 2.34.0, Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM) is used for handling the installation and updating of operators for PMM in an effective, automated, and scalable manner.
- [PMM-11069](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11069) - [Backups]: PMM no longer allows creating backup tasks with a name that already exists. After upgrading to PMM 2.34, any backup tasks with duplicate names are automatically renamed to apply the new naming constraints.

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-7350](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7350)   - [DBaaS]: Fixed an issue where DB Cluster did not restart all PXC servers and proxy SQL servers on restarting.
- [PMM-11333](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11333) - [DBaaS]: Fixed an issue where the API key was missing on K8s cluster registration after moving to Operator Lifecycle Management (OLM).
- [PMM-9505](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9505)   - [DBaaS]: The options to update, restart, and view logs were enabled for paused clusters. This issue has now been resolved by disabling these options.
- [PMM-11221](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11221) - [DBaaS]: Fixed an issue where the page did not load when DBaaS was disabled.

## Known issues

- Starting with PMM 2.34.0, the recommended version for running Percona XtraDB cluster is 8.0.27. It's impossible to create Percona XtraDB clusters using a version older than 8.0.27. All previously created clusters are not affected and will be migrated without any issues.
- [PMM-11474](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11474): If more than two Kubernetes clusters are registered with PMM, and database cluster credentials are requested, an internal server error may occur.
