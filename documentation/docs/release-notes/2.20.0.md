Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- The [Easy-install script] for PMM Server is checksum verified.
- PMM will use [Grafana 7.5] instead of 7.3. We are also preparing for Grafana 8.
- PostgreSQL monitoring with the `pg_stat_monitor` plugin enabled exposes new metrics such as Plan Times, WAL Fpi/Bytes/Records.
- For users who deploy PMM Server through the AWS Marketplace, AWS RDS service discovery will be executed without AWS credentials and tuning [IAM roles].
- For Backup Management (Technical Preview), we added the ability to schedule backups so you can schedule and see already scheduled [backups] in the UI.

## Important note for users of PMM who started out using the Docker image of 2.16.0

If you installed PMM [version 2.16] as a new Docker image and have since used the home dashboard upgrade widget to upgrade to any of 2.17, 2.18, or 2.19, you might experience problems with monitoring the PMM server itself, Remote Monitoring, or RDS/Azure monitoring. If you experience any of these problems, you can simply run the following commands to get your instance working and it will be automatically resolved in the next release:

1. Enter the container: `docker exec -it pmm-server bash`
2. Roll back `pmm2-client` package to stable version: `yum downgrade -y pmm2-client`

Alternatively, you can replace the existing Docker container with a fresh install of the latest release by following the [official instructions for an upgrade](../setting-up/server/docker.md#upgrade). (This will guide you through taking a backup of your PMM Server and restoring it after installing a fresh docker image of PMM Server.)
