Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.


## Release Highlights

### Access Control: Limit access to metrics

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important/Caution"
    Disclaimer:  PMM Access Control is still in Technical Preview and is subject to change. We recommend that early adopters use this feature for testing purposes only.

We are pleased to announce that PMM 2.35.0 marks the first step towards introducing PMM Access Control. Label-based access control in PMM allows you to manage who has access to metrics based on labels. 

By creating roles, you can specify which data can be queried based on specific label criteria, for instance, allowing the QA team to view data related to test environments. Using this feature, you can associate multiple labels with a role, ensuring only data from series that match your defined labels is returned. 

This feature provides a standardized method for granting, changing, and revoking access to metrics, giving you a powerful and flexible way to manage access to metrics and ensure secure access to the information you need. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/get-started/roles-and-permissions/index.html).

### GA: Deployment of PMM in Kubernetes with Helm Chart

We are happy to announce the General Availability of PMM deployment in Kubernetes with the Helm chart. PMM deployment via Helm chart in Kubernetes has been available as Tech Preview since PMM v2.29, but now we're delighted to offer it to users as a fully supported feature. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/setting-up/server/helm.html).  

### DBaaS: Add a backup schedule while creating DB clusters

Starting with PMM 2.35.0, you can add a backup schedule while creating DB clusters in DBaaS. This feature is a fusion of backup management and DBaaS in PMM. Currently, DBaaS only supports scheduled backups, which can only be enabled when a database cluster is created.

DBaaS **does not** support on-demand backups. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/dbaas/backup_restore.html).  

### DBaaS: Restore cluster from backup stored on S3

You can now create a DBaaS cluster from a backup stored on S3. You can use backups taken from existing cluster and use them to spin-up a new database cluster from this backup. Attempts to use it to restore a previous version of the cluster will result in downtime since the system will treat it as a creation of a new cluster.

DBaaS **does not** support on-demand restore. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/dbaas/backup_restore.html).

### More pre-run checks for MongoDB backups
With this release, PMM runs additional verifications to ensure infrastructure compliance and prevent backup execution errors:

#### Tool compatibility check

Before initiating backups for MongoDB, PMM now examines the current MongoDB node to ensure that the connected PMM Agents have the tools to execute and finalize the backup.

If the requirements are not met, PMM reports what tools or tool versions are missing, similarly to the existing prerequisites check for MySQL backups.

#### Overlapping  jobs check

To avoid conflicting jobs, PMM proactively disables the creation of  Point-in-time Recovery (PITR), or snapshot backups, when other backups are scheduled for running.

Similarly, creating PITR backups for different services of the same cluster is now automatically restricted.

#### Cluster membership check

To avoid execution errors, PMM no longer allows scheduling backups on MongoDB Services that are not managed as a cluster.

You can check which of your current Services are not members of a cluster on the **PMM Inventory > Services** page. Services that do not specify a cluster name in the **Other Details** column should be removed and re-added using the following set of commands:

<pre>pmm-admin add mongodb
username=pmm_mongodb --password=password 
query-source=profiler <mark>--cluster=mycluster</mark></code></pre>


### Backup restore logs accessible from PMM

With this release, we are adding the option to view the logs for restores from a MongoDB database backup.
This complements the existing option to view the logs for the backup process and makes it easier to gather data for compliance, auditing, and troubleshooting purposes.

Instead of having to look through PBM log files, you can now access the **Log** option in PMM, which is now automatically displayed next to each MongoDB backup restore entry on the **Backup > Restores** page.

### Components Upgrade

MongoDB exporter has been upgraded to 0.37.0.

## New Features

- [PMM-10325](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10325) - Starting with PMM 2.35.0, for enhanced security, you can change the admin password even after `pmm-agent` is registered on the PMM Server.

- [PMM-10550](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10550) - [Backup Management]: PMM now automatically displays a `Logs` option next to each MongoDB backup restore entry on the **Backup > Restores** page.

- [PMM-11302](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11302) - [DBaaS]: Starting with PMM 2.35.0, you can add a backup schedule while creating DB clusters in DBaaS. You can also restore the cluster from backup stored on S3.

- [PMM-10962](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10962) - Starting with PMM 2.35.0, we have introduced Access Control. Roles are a vital part of Access Control that provide the users with access to specified metrics. You can create, edit, and delete user roles. The roles can be assigned to the users with the **Configuration > Users** tab. For more information, see [documentation]().

## Improvements

- [PMM-10471](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10471) - [Backup Management]: PMM now automatically checks the current MongoDB node to ensure that the connected PMM Agents have the tools to execute and finalize the backup.
