Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

The goal for this small release was to eliminate a lot of bugs and complete some features.

- DBaaS

    Added the ability for PMM to install the latest versions of the K8s operator into the K8s cluster. There is no longer any need to install the operator manually. Just connect PMM to your K8s cluster and let PMM do the rest.

- Backup Management

    Backup functionality was released as a Technical Preview feature and will require specific prerequisites from the user side to be installed. Currently, PMM will allow you to:

    - manage storage for backups (S3 only);
    - execute a backup for MySQL and Mongo instances;
    - restore a MySQL backup to the same instance from where it was taken (via the UI).

    Restore in other cases is not yet implemented on the UI.
