!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important note for users of PMM 2.24.0"
    2.24.0 AMI image has only 8GB available for the data, it is a bug (see [PMM-9298](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9298)). To resize a disk to full size you need to login to AMI instance with SSH and use the following command:

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm-update/main/ansible/playbook/tasks/create-lvm.yml -o lvn-fix.yml && sudo ansible-playbook lvn-fix.yml
    ```

    For instructions about how to access your instances by using an SSH client, see [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/aws.html#:~:text=Connecting%20to%20Your%20Linux%20Instance%20Using%20SSH)
    Make sure to replace the user name ec2-user used in this document with admin.

    What this command does:

    1. Downloads Ansible playbook and runs it
    2. Copy your data from /srv to the temporary directory
    3. Create lvm partition
    4. Copy data from system disk to a new LVM partition

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.
## Release Highlights
- **Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring**
  - Beginning with this release, PMM now supports monitoring of PostgreSQL 14, both - Community edition and [Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://www.percona.com/software/postgresql-distribution).
  - We've made significant improvements in exposed data and added additional features if you monitor PostgreSQL together with the [pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor) extension (Part of Percona distribution for PostgreSQL). These features include:
    - The PostgreSQL queries will have complete Query Execution Plan information. This will help with future optimization of queries and give a clear understanding of query performance
    - Query execution histograms collection and presentation inside Query Analytics for a much more detailed understanding of query executions.
    - Query analytics will both show and let the user drill down to the Top Query of the particular query if it's a subquery and have this parent query. This feature will allow users to see the dependencies between queries better and understand the impact of subqueries.
    - Query Analytics can filter PostgreSQL queries by query commands like SELECT, UPDATE, etc., and by Application Name if it's set for PostgreSQL connection from the application.


- **Integrated Alerting (Technical preview):**
    - Alerting in PMM now has an additional notification channel type - webhooks. So now, users can integrate Alerting with any tool they use for Incident management.  Read more about new notification channels and how to set them up in [our documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/get-started/alerting.html#add-a-notification-channel)
