# Percona Monitoring and Management 2.43.2-1 (2025-03-12)
                                                                 
Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. 

It provides tools to observe database health, analyze performance trends, troubleshoot issues, and execute database management tasksâ€”whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud.

## SEVERITY: CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

A critical vulnerability has been identified in PMM Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) installations that enables unauthorized `root` access and potential exposure of system credentials. This vulnerability is tracked as [CVE-2025-26701](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2025-26701).

### Immediate actions required

1. UPGRADE IMMEDIATELY to PMM 2.43.2-1 or to the latest PMM 2 release [PMM 2.44.0-1](../release-notes/2.44.0.1.md).
2. CHANGE ALL CREDENTIALS for connected services.
3. AUDIT ACCESS LOGS for potential unauthorized access.

### Vulnerability details
This vulnerability stems from default service account credentials in OVA provisioning that enables:

 - unauthorized SSH access
 - privilege escalation to `root` via `sudo` capabilities
 - potential exposure of service credentials and configurations

### Affected installations  
The table below lists currently known affected deployments. We will update it if additional deployments are identified as vulnerable:

| Affected deployments                     | Version | Notes |
|-------------------------------------------|---------|-------|
| PMM Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) installations | PMM 2.38.0 through  2.44.0 and PMM 3.0.0 |  Fixed in  PMM 2.43.2-1, 2.44.0-1 and 3.0.0-1    |


!!! warning "Restrict SSH access"
    PMM OVA installations should never have port `22` exposed to the public Internet unless you have implemented additional security hardening measures. Always use firewalls, VPNs, or other secure remote access methods.

### Not affected installations
This vulnerability affects ONLY OVA installations. The following deployment methods are NOT impacted:

- Docker/Podman containers
- Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- Kubernetes deployments (via Helm)

### Mitigation options  

=== "PREFERRED: Upgrade to PMM 2.43.2-1 or 2.44.0-1"
    This release enhances security in OVA deployments by automatically removing unnecessary system accounts during the initial setup.

    To secure your system, follow these steps to upgrade:

    1. Download and deploy the new OVA file from [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads).

    2. Log in to your system:
        ```sh
        ssh admin@your-pmm-server
        ```

    3. Switch to `root` or use `sudo` for the following commands:
        ```sh
        sudo -i
        # or use sudo before each command
        ```
    4. Stop services on your current installation: 
        ```sh 
        supervisorctl stop all
        ```
    5. Back up and transfer your data:
        ```sh
        cd /srv
        tar -cvf srv.tar .
        ``` 
    6. Transfer srv.tar to new server via scp.

    7. Deploy data on the new installation:
        ```sh
        # Stop all services
        supervisorctl stop all

        # Clear existing data
        cd /srv
        rm -rf *

        # Extract backup
        tar -xvf PATH_TO/srv.tar

        # Start all services
        supervisorctl start all
        ```
    8. Update DNS records or swap IP addresses to ensure uninterrupted Client connectivity.

    #### Verification steps

    After upgrading, verify that your system is functioning correctly:

    1. Check service status to confirm both PMM Client and PMM Server are running:
        ```sh
        supervisorctl status
        ```
    2. Ensure Client connectivity to validate data flow.

    3. Test system functionality by performing basic monitoring tasks.

=== "TEMPORARY MITIGATION: If you cannot upgrade immediately"
    If an upgrade is not immediately possible, follow these steps to mitigate the vulnerability:

    1. Secure SSH access:
        - block port `22` access at firewall level
        - if remote access is required, restrict it to specific IP addresses
        - consider using a VPN for remote management

    2. Log in to your system:
        ```sh
        ssh admin@your-pmm-server
        ```
    3. Switch to `root` or use `sudo` for the following commands:
        ```sh
        sudo -i
        # or use sudo before each command
        ```
    4. Execute ONE of these commands to secure the vulnerable account:

        - disable login:
            ```sh
            usermod -s /sbin/nologin vagrant
            ```

        - lock account:
            ```sh
            passwd -l vagrant
            ```

        - remove user completely:
            ```sh
            kill -9 $(pgrep -f vagrant)
            userdel -r vagrant
            ```
    5. Update service credentials:

        - change monitoring user passwords in your databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
        - update any custom service accounts you've created
        - rotate authentication tokens for monitored services
        - update corresponding credentials in PMM configuration
        - configure SSH access: add public key via **PMM Configuration > Settings > SSH Key**

    6. Monitor system logs for unauthorized access.
