# Percona Monitoring and Management 2.44.0-1

**Release date**: February 10th, 2025                                                                            

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open-source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. 

It provides tools to observe database health, analyze performance trends, troubleshoot issues, and execute database management tasksâ€”whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud.


## Security advisory: Critical vulnerability

A critical vulnerability has been identified in OVA installations of PMM 2.38 and above, as described in [CVE-xxxx-xxxx](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=xxxx-xxxx). If you are running any of these OVA installations, we strongly recommend upgrading immediately to this release.

The vulnerability was caused by default service account credentials used in OVA provisioning, which had weak password security and enabled SSH login access. 
These issues could allow unauthorized SSH access and potential privilege escalation to `root` via `sudo` capabilities.

### Scope of impact
- Affected: PMM Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) installations, version 2.38 and above
- Not affected: PMM Docker installations, PMM Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
- Severity: CRITICAL when the SSH port is exposed to the Internet

### Fix and security enhancements 

This release strengthens security in OVA deployments by removing unnecessary system accounts during the initial setup. The new OVA installations automatically remove unnecessary system accounts and include built-in security measures:

- automatic security hardening during the first boot

- enhanced system access controls to prevent unauthorized access

- improved default security configurations for safer deployments

### Upgrade instructions

To secure your system, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Download and deploy the new OVA from [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads).
2. Stop services on your current installation: 
    ```sh 
    supervisorctl stop all
    ```
3. Back up and transfer your data:
    ```sh
    cd /srv
    tar -cvf srv.tar .
    # Transfer to new server
    ```

4. Deploy data on the new installation:
    ```sh
    supervisorctl stop all
    cd /srv
    tar -xvf srv.tar
    supervisorctl start all
    ```
5. Update DNS records or swap IP addresses to ensure uninterrupted Client connectivity.

### Verification steps

After upgrading, verify that your system is functioning correctly:

1. Check service status to confirm both PMM Client and PMM Server are running.

2. Ensure Client connectivity to validate data flow.

3. Test system functionality by performing basic monitoring tasks.
