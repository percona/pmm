### Mitigation options 

#### PREFERRED: Upgrade to PMM 2.44.0-1
This release enhances security in OVA deployments by automatically removing unnecessary system accounts during the initial setup.

To secure your system, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Download and deploy the new OVA file from [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads).

2. Stop services on your current installation: 
    ```sh 
    supervisorctl stop all
    ```
3. Back up and transfer your data:
    ```sh
    cd /srv
    tar -cvf srv.tar .
    # Transfer to new server
    ```

4. Deploy data on the new installation:
    ```sh
    supervisorctl stop all
    cd /srv
    tar -xvf srv.tar
    supervisorctl start all
    ```
5. Update DNS records or swap IP addresses to ensure uninterrupted Client connectivity.

##### Verification steps

After upgrading, verify that your system is functioning correctly:

1. Check service status to confirm both PMM Client and PMM Server are running.

2. Ensure Client connectivity to validate data flow.

3. Test system functionality by performing basic monitoring tasks.


#### TEMPORARY: If you cannot upgrade immediately

1. Block port 22 access.
2. Execute ONE of these commands to secure the vulnerable account:
    ```sh
    sudo usermod -s /sbin/nologin vagrant    # Disable login
    sudo passwd -l vagrant                   # Lock account
    sudo kill -9 $(pgrep -f vagrant); sudo userdel -r vagrant    # Remove user
    ```    
3. Change all service passwords.
4. Monitor system logs for unauthorized access.
