Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe database health, analyze performance trends, troubleshoot issues, and execute database management tasksâ€”whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud.


!!! note "Security advisory: Critical vulnerability"
        OVA installations of PMM 2.38 and above, as described in [CVE-xxxx-xxxx](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=xxxx-xxxx). If you are running any of these OVA installations, we strongly recommend upgrading immediately to this release.

         ### Scope of impact
            - **Affected**: PMM Open Virtual Appliance (OVA) installations, version 2.38 and above
            - **Not affected**: PMM Docker installations, PMM Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
            - **Severity**: CRITICAL when SSH port is exposed to the Internet


## Fixed CVE and security enhancements 

This release strengthens security in OVA deployments by automatically removing unnecessary system accounts during the initial setup. New OVA installations now include built-in security measures, eliminating the need for manual intervention.

Key improvements:

 - Automatic security hardening during the first boot.

- Enhanced system access controls to prevent unauthorized access.

- Improved default security configurations for safer deployments.

The vulnerability stemmed from default service account credentials used in OVA provisioning, which had weak password security and enabled SSH login access. These issues could allow unauthorized SSH access and potential privilege escalation to `root` via `sudo` capabilities.

### Upgrade instructions

To secure your system, follow these steps to upgrade:

1. Download and deploy the new OVA from [Percona website](https://www.percona.com/downloads).
2. Stop services on your current installation: 
    ```sh 
        supervisorctl stop all
    ```
3. Back up and transfer your data:
    ```sh
    cd /srv
    tar -cvf srv.tar .
    # Transfer to new server
    ```

4. Deploy data on the new installation:
    ```sh
    supervisorctl stop all
    cd /srv
    tar -xvf srv.tar
    supervisorctl start all
    ```
5. Update DNS records or swap IP addresses to ensure uninterrupted client connectivity.

### Verification steps

After upgrading, verify that your system is functioning correctly:

1. Check service status to confirm both PMM Client and PMM Server are running.

2. Ensure Client connectivity to validate data flow.

3. Test system functionality by performing basic monitoring tasks.
