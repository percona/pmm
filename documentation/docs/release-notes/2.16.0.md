Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Important note for users of PMM 2.16.0

If you started using PMM from version 2.16 and have already upgraded to 2.17, 2.18, or 2.19, you might have some problems with PMM Server monitoring, Remove Monitoring, or RDS/Azure monitoring. If you experience a problem, we recommend you upgrade and replace the Docker container by following the official instructions for an upgrade here: <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/docker.html#upgrade>.

If you can't do this, then you need to perform additional steps after upgrading to 2.20.

1. Enter the container: `docker exec -it pmm-server bash`
2. Roll back `pmm2-client` package to stable version: `yum downgrade -y pmm2-client`

## Release Highlights

- **Amazon RDS PostgreSQL monitoring**

    AWS monitoring in PMM now covers PostgreSQL RDS and PostgreSQL Aurora types. PMM will include them in a [Discovery UI](../setting-up/client/aws.md#adding-an-amazon-rds-postgresql-instance) where they can be added which will result in node related metrics as well as PostgreSQL database performance metrics. Before this release, this was available only to MySQL-related instances from Amazon RDS.

- **Azure Discovery and Node metrics extraction**

    **Technical Preview**: PMM will have the same level of support for Microsoft Azure Database as a Service (DBaaS) as we have for AWS's DBaaS (RDS/Aurora on MySQL or PostgreSQL). You will be able to easily discover and add Azure databases for monitoring by PMM complete with node-level monitoring. This feature is available only if you explicitly activate it on the *PMM Settings* page. Deactivating it will not remove added services from monitoring, but will just hide the ability to discover and add new Microsoft Azure Services.

    (This is a feature technical preview because we want to release it as soon as possible to get feedback from users. We are expecting to do more work on this feature to make it more API and resource efficient.)

- **Security Threat Tool Scheduling - Manage execution and execution intervals**

    Security Threat Tool users are now able to control the Security Check execution time intervals for groups of checks, move checks between groups, and disable individual checks if necessary.

- **Support for pg_stat_monitor 0.8**

    Added compatibility with [pg_stat_monitor plugin v 0.8.0](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/releases/tag/REL0_8_0_STABLE ). This is not exposing the new features for the plugin in PMM yet, but ensures Query Analytics metrics are collected to the same degree it was with version 0.6.0 of the plugin.

- **Consistent support of Technical Preview Features**

    Reworked the PMM Settings page to make it clear what features are in Technical Preview vs General Availability (GA) and to simplify activation/deactivation of technical preview features. We also provide a better definition of what a [Technical Preview](../details/glossary.md#technical-preview) is.

- **Migration of Settings and other service pages in PMM from Grafana dashboards**

    The *PMM Settings* page and several others (including *Add Instance* and *Inventory*) are being converted to Grafana pages and will no longer be presented as dashboards. Additionally, we're moving the menu to the sidebar navigation for consistency and more flexibility compared to the older menu structure.

- **Integrated Alerting improvements**

    We released the next stage of improvements in Integrated Alerting functionality of PMM to simplify the usage of the feature. Together with improvements, we continue fixing known bugs in this feature.

- **[DBaaS] Resource planning and prediction (Resource calculator)**

    **Technical preview**: While creating a DB cluster a user can see a prediction of the resources this cluster will consume with all components as well as the current total and available resources in the K8s. Users will be warned that if they attempt to create a DB cluster it may be unsuccessful because of available resources in the K8s.

- **[DBaaS] PSMDB 1.7.0 operator support**

    DBaaS in PMM will be using the recently-released [Percona Kubernetes Operator for Percona Server for MongoDB 1.7.0](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-psmongodb/RN/Kubernetes-Operator-for-PSMONGODB-RN1.7.0.html) to create MongoDB clusters.
