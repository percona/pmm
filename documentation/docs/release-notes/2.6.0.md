Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## New Features

- [PMM-5728](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5728): Technical preview of External Services monitoring feature. A new command provides integration with hundreds of third-party systems ([https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)) via the Prometheus protocol so that you can monitor external services on a node where PMM agent is installed.
- [PMM-5822](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5822): PMM now includes a Security Threat Tool to help users avoid the most common database security issues.
- [PMM-5559](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5559): Global annotations can now be set with the `pmm-admin annotate` command.
- [PMM-4931](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4931): PMM now checks Docker environment variables and warns about invalid ones.

## Improvements

- [PMM-1962](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-1962): The PMM Server API (via `/v1/readyz`) now also returns Grafana status information in addition to that for Prometheus.
- [PMM-5854](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5854): The Service Details dashboards were cleaned up and some unused selectors were removed.
- [PMM-5775](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5775): It is now clearer which nodes are Primary and which are Secondary on MongoDB Instance dashboards.
- [PMM-5549](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5549): PMM’s Grafana component is now the latest, 6.7.3.
- [PMM-5393](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5393): There’s a new ‘Node Summary’ row in the services Summary and Details dashboards summarizing the system update, load average, RAM and memory.
- [PMM-4778](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4778): `mongodb_exporter` is now the latest version, 0.11.0.
- [PMM-5734](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5734): Temporary files activity and utilization charts (`rate` & `irate`) were added to the PostgreSQL Instance overview.
- [PMM-5695](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5695): The error message explains better when using the `–-socket` option incorrectly.

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-4829](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4829): The MongoDB Exporter wasn’t able to collect metrics from hidden nodes without either the latest driver or using the `connect-direct` parameter.
- [PMM-5056](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5056): The average values for Query time in the Details and Profile sections were different.
- [PMM-2717](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-2717): Updating MongoDB Exporter resolves an error (`Failed to execute find query on 'config.locks': not found.`) when used with `shardedCluster` 3.6.4.
- [PMM-4541](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4541): MongoDB exporter metrics collection was including system collections from `collStats` and `indexStats`, causing “log bloat”.
- [PMM-5913](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5913): Only totals were shown in QAN when filtering on `Cluster=MongoDB`.
- [PMM-5903](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5903): When applying a filter the QAN Overview was being refreshed twice.
- [PMM-5821](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5821): The Compare button was missing from HA Dashboard main menus.
- [PMM-5687](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5687): Cumulative charts for Disk Details were not showing any data if metrics were returning `NaN`           results.
- [PMM-5663](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5663): The ‘version’ value was not being refreshed in various MySQL dashboards.
- [PMM-5643](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5643): Advanced Data Exploration charts were showing ‘N/A’ for Metric Resolution and ‘No data to show’ in the Metric Data Table.
- [PMM-4756](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4756): Dashboards were not showing services with empty environments.
- [PMM-4562](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4562): MongoDB and MySQL registered instances with empty cluster labels (`–environment=<label>`) were not visible in the dashboard despite being added instances.
- [PMM-4906](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4906): The MongoDB exporter for MongoDB 4.0 and above was causing a “log bloat” condition.
