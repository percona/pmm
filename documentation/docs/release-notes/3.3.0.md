## Platform support changes and deprecations

### Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) 

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal Fossa) reached its End of Life on May 31, 2025. Consequently, we no longer build PMM Client packages for this platform. 

If your PMM Client is running on Ubuntu 20.04, upgrade your operating system to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS or a later version, and then reinstall PMM Client using the package version for your new Ubuntu release. 

Existing installations on Ubuntu 20.04 will continue to work but we will not release further updates. Source packages (.sdeb) are now built on Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 20.04. 

## Improvements

- [PMM-13970](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13970) - Added `--tls-skip-verify` flag for `pmm-admin add external`, `pmm-admin add external-serverless`, and `pmm-admin add haproxy` commands. This flag skips TLS certificate validation, enabling you to monitor services with self-signed certificates or IP-based endpoints that lack proper certificate SANs, including PostgreSQL Operator deployments with HAProxy.

- [PMM-14000](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14000), [PMM-13861](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13861), [PMM-13862](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13862), [PMM-13863](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13863), [PMM-13864](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13864), [PMM-13865](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13865), [PMM-13866](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13866), [PMM-13867](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13867), [PMM-13868](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13868) - Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring with five new dashboards, improved existing dashboards, custom query support for specialized metrics, and a redesigned menu structure with dedicated **High Availability** section for better navigation.
