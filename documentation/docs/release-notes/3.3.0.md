## Improvements

- [PMM-13970](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13970) - Added `--tls-skip-verify` flag for `pmm-admin add external`, `pmm-admin add external-serverless`, and `pmm-admin add haproxy` commands. This flag skips TLS certificate validation, enabling you to monitor services with self-signed certificates or IP-based endpoints that lack proper certificate SANs, including PostgreSQL Operator deployments with HAProxy.
