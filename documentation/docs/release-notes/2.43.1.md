| **Installation** | [Installing Percona Monitoring and Management](../quickstart/index.md) |

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them, and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Fixed issue: PMM 2.43.0 upgrade failure

This release addresses the upgrade failure to PMM 2.43.0 via the UI. The issue affected PMM Servers running versions prior to 2.43.0, where an outdated version of `percona-release` resulted in a missing `percona-telemetry-agent` package during the PostgreSQL 14 upgrade process.

### Resolution

Upgrading directly to PMM 2.43.1 will bypass this issue entirely.

### Workaround for ongoing 2.43.0 upgrades

If you've already initiated an upgrade to 2.43.0 and wish to complete this specific installation, follow the workaround below for Docker installations:

Before retrying the upgrade run `docker exec -t pmm-server dnf clean all`, then proceed with the 2.43.0 upgrade.

This command refreshes package metadata, resolving dependency issues and allowing the upgrade to proceed smoothly.
