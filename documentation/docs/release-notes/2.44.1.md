Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them, and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release summary

PMM 2.44.1 is a maintenance release that focuses on improving MongoDB monitoring reliability and addressing security vulnerabilities through updated Docker images.

## What's new

### PMM v3 migration notice

When you launch PMM 2, you’ll now see a notification prompting you to migrate to PMM v3, as PMM 2 is no longer actively developed.

This highlights PMM v3’s enhanced security, improved stability, and overall smoother experience. It also includes a direct link to the migration documentation to help guide you through the process.

Since the release of PMM 3 in January 2025, PMM 2 has entered its maintenance phase, receiving only Critical and High CVE fixes for six months after PMM 3.0.0's release. For continued support and to access all future improvements, we strongly recommend upgrading to PMM 3.

### Fixed visibility of offline MongoDB replica set nodes

Fixed a monitoring gap in the [MongoDB ReplSet Summary](../details/dashboards/dashboard-replsetsummary.md) dashboard, where nodes in a "down" state occasionally disappeared from the **States** panel, and their version details were removed from the **MongoDB Versions** panel.

Nodes in down state now remain consistently visible in both panels with a clear **Down** status (highlighted in red) and their last known version information preserved. 

### Security enhancements

PMM 2.44.1 Docker images include important security updates that address the following vulnerabilities Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs):

- [CVE-2023-45288](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-GOLANG-GOLANGORGXNETHTTPHTTPPROXY-9058601) - Fixed a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in golang.org/x/net/http/httpproxy by updating to version 0.36.0. This vulnerability could potentially allow attackers to bypass proxy restrictions.

- Fixed a GPL-2.0 license compliance issue in `percona-toolkit` components, affecting the `fingerprinter`, `proto`, and `stats` modules, ensuring alignment with open source licensing best practices.
