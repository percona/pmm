Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance. You can run *PMM* in your own environment for maximum security and reliability. It provides thorough time-based analysis for MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL servers to ensure that your data works as efficiently as possible.

Main improvements in this release are:

- Alternative installation methods available for PMM 1.x are re-implemented for PMM 2: now PMM Server can be installed as a virtual appliance, or run using AWS Marketplace
- AWS RDS and remote instances monitoring re-added in this release include AWS RDS MySQL / Aurora MySQL instances, and remote PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and ProxySQL ones
- The new Settings dashboard allows configuring PMM Server via the graphical interface

For *PMM* install instructions, see [Installing PMM Server](../setting-up/server/index.md) and [Installing PMM Client](../setting-up/client/index.md).

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Caution"
    PMM 2 is designed to be used as a new installation — please don’t try to upgrade your existing PMM 1 environment.

## Improvements and new features

- [PMM-4575](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4575): The new PMM Settings dashboard allows users to configure various PMM Server options: setting metrics resolution and data retention, enabling or disabling send usage data statistics back to Percona and checking for updates; this dashboard is now the proper place to upload your public key for the SSH login and to download PMM Server logs for diagnostics
- [PMM-4907](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4907) and [PMM-4767](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4767): The user’s AMI Instance ID is now used to setup running PMM Server using AWS Marketplace as an additional verification on the user, based on the Amazon Marketplace rules
- [PMM-4950](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4950) and [PMM-3094](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-3094): Alternative [AWS partitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/api/aws/endpoints/#pkg-constants)  are now supported when adding an AWS RDS MySQL or Aurora MySQL Instance to PMM
- [PMM-4976](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4976): Home dashboard clean-up: “Systems under monitoring” and “Network IO” `singlestats` were refined to be based on the `host` variable; also avoiding using color as an indicator of state; “All” row elements were relinked to the “Nodes Overview” dashboard with regards to the selected host.
- [PMM-4800](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4800): The `pmm-admin add mysql` command has been modified to make help text more descriptive: now when you enable `tablestats` you will get more detail on if they’re enabled for your environment and where you stand with respect to the auto-disable limit
- [PMM-4969](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4969): Update Grafana to version 6.5.1
- [PMM-5053](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5053): A tooltip was added to the Head Block graph on the Prometheus dashboard
- [PMM-5068](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5068): Drill-down links were added to the Node Summary dashboard graphs
- [PMM-5050](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5050): Drill-down links were added to the graphs on all Services Compare dashboards
- [PMM-5037](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5037): Drill-down links were added to all graphs on the Services Overview dashboards
- [PMM-4988](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4988): Filtering in Query Analytics have undergone improvements to make group selection more intuitive: Labels unavailable under the current selection are shown as gray/disabled, and the percentage values are dynamically recalculated to reflect Labels available within the currently applied filters
- [PMM-4966](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4966): All passwords are now substituted with asterisk signs in the exporter logs for security reasons when not in debug mode
- [PMM-527](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-527): `node_exporter` is now providing hardware monitoring information such as CPU temperatures and fan statuses; while this information is being collected by PMM Server, it will not be shown until a dedicated dashboard is added in a future release
- [PMM-3198](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-3198): Instead of showing All graphs for all services by default, MySQL Command/Handler Counters Compare dashboard now shows the predefined set of ten most informative ones, to reduce load on PMM Server at its first open

## Fixed bugs

- [PMM-4978](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4978): The “Top MySQL Questions” `singlestat` on the MySQL Instances Overview dashboard was changed to show ops instead of percentage
- [PMM-4917](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4917): The “Systems under monitoring” and “Monitored DB Instances” `singlestats` on the Home dashboard now have a sparkline to make situation more clear with recently shut down nodes/instances

- [PMM-4981](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4981): Disable automatic color gradient in filled graphs on all dashboards
- [PMM-4941](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4941): Some charts were incorrectly showing empty fragments with high time resolution turned on
- [PMM-5022](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5022): Fix outdated drill-down links on the Prometheus Exporters Overview and Nodes Overview dashboards
- [PMM-5023](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5023): Make the All instances `uptime singlestat` on the Home dashboard to show `Min` values instead of `Avg`
- [PMM-5029](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5029): Option to upload dashboard snapshot to Percona was disappearing after upgrade to 2.1.x
- [PMM-4946](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4946): Rename singlestats on the Home dashboard for better clarity: “Systems under monitoring” to “Nodes under monitoring” and “Monitored DB Instances” to “Monitored DB Services”, and make the last one to count remote DB instances also
- [PMM-5015](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5015): Fix format of Disk Page Buffers singlestat on the Compare dashboard for PostgreSQL to have two digits precision for the consistency with other singlestats

- [PMM-4804](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4804): Incorrect parameters validation required both `service-name` and `service-id` parameters of the `pmm-admin remove` command to be presented, while the command itself demanded only one of them to identify the service.
- [PMM-3298](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-3298): Panic errors were present in the `rds_exporter` log after adding an RDS instance from the second AWS account
- [PMM-5089](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5089): The `serialize-javascript` package was updated to version 2.1.1 because of the possibility of regular expressions cross-site scripting vulnerability in it (CVE-2019-16769). Please note PMM versions were not affected by this vulnerability, as `serialize-javascript` package is used as a build dependency only.
- [PMM-5149](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5149): Disk Space `singlestat` was unable to show data for RDS instances because of not taking into account sources with unknown file system type
