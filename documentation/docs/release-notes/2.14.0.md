Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- Switch to push metrics by default

    In PMM 2.12.0, Percona replaced its metrics collection engine (formerly Prometheus) with VictoriaMetrics. Historically, PMM used a *pull* method with Prometheus while VictoriaMetrics can operate in either a *pull* or *push* method. When PMM 2.12.0 was released, Percona kept the default method as *pull*. Now with PMM 2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to *push* for all newly-added instances. This [blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/01/foiled-by-the-firewall-a-tale-of-transition-from-prometheus-to-victoriametrics/) describes the two methods and why *push* benefits users. Also, [here is a post](https://www.percona.com/blog/2020/12/16/percona-monitoring-and-management-migration-from-prometheus-to-victoriametrics-faq/) by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the push model. Documentation on the push method is [here](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/victoria-metrics.html).

    **Note**: Installing the 2.14.0 or newer PMM server will change the default behavior on 2.12.0 and 2.13.0 clients from "pull" method to "push" for any newly added services. Existing services will remain in whatever mode they were prior to upgrade.

- DBaaS Preview phase 1.0 (Technical  Preview)

    In 2.13.0 we introduced Percona's Database as a Service (DBaaS) which enables non-DBAs (software architects, developers, site reliability engineers, etc.) to perform typical DBA tasks to manage an organization's database environment via user interfaces and automation orchestration.  This release contains several enhancements and fixes, many directly from user feedback.

    **Note**: This capability is feature-flagged and turned off by default. Users require a variable to be passed to PMM to expose this functionality.

- External services presentation on node summary dashboard

    Improvements to the user experience for adding and viewing external services (any data that can be monitored by a Prometheus exporter such as: non-Percona supported databases like Redis, ElasticSearch, Cassandra, etc. or an organization's external application) on the Node Summary dashboard of PMM.

## New Features

- [PMM-5765](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5765): Ability to monitor External Services for situations where PMM Client can't be installed -- Uses a new command `pmm-admin add external-serverless`. (See [pmm-admin](../details/commands/pmm-admin.md).) (This is a **Technical Preview** feature)
- [PMM-7015](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7015): DBaaS Preview: Create DB cluster with randomly-generated password
- [PMM-7007](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7007): Integrated Alerting: Ability to copy (duplicate) alert rules
- [PMM-7006](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7006): Integrated Alerting: Ability to delete alert rules

- [PMM-7145](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7145): 'Push' metrics mode is default when adding services and nodes (All agents collecting data from Services and Nodes will now use PUSH model if not specified explicitly. You will still be able to use `--metrics-mode` flag to use Pull metrics if needed. All previously set up agents will keep their existing mode. To change these you need to remove and re-add them.)
