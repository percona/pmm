## Release Highlights


### Improved Inventory view

This release of PMM starts the series of enhancements that will improve the way you work with Services and Nodes in PMM. 
With this first set of changes, we’re revamping the **Inventory** page to give you more context on your inventory objects, and more actionable information for exploring and fixing possible issues. 

Here are all the specific changes: 

- Improved design of the **Inventory** page for a clearer presentation of all the objects registered by PMM. 
- Services now show their database status, which is based on the monitoring metrics. This enables you to quickly check the status of the databases when you are working with the inventory.  
- New **Monitoring** column showing the live status for the monitoring Agents assigned to a Service. This enables you to quickly spot any possible issues with the Agents.
- Quick access to the Service Summary **Dashboard** and to **QueryAnalytics** results so that you can easily explore important related information. 
- New **Details** section grouping together all the relevant parameters and labels for a Service. To keep things clean, this section is collapsed by default, so that you can view extra information only when you need it. 

Here's what's coming:

Building up on these changes, subsequent releases will further improve PMM Inventory with:

- More useful features to filter and better connect Services and Nodes.
- Services organized in clusters so that you can capture the bigger picture, instead of working at of individual Service-level.

### New Experimental Dashboards for Kubernetes Monitoring

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    These experimental dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.

We are pleased to announce the release of PMM 2.37, which introduces three new experimental dashboards:

- Kubernetes Cluster Summary
- Kubernetes Pods Status
- Kubernetes Volumes 

These dashboards are designed to provide valuable insights into the status and performance of your Kubernetes cluster, pods, and volumes, helping you to identify and troubleshoot issues quickly and easily.

We welcome your feedback as we continue to enhance PMM with these new dashboards.

**Experimental Kubernetes Cluster Summary Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Cluster Summary* provides a comprehensive overview of your Kubernetes cluster, including:

- Components
- Node
- Pod
- PVC status
- CPU
- Memory overview, and more. 

This dashboard displays all workloads running in the cluster, enabling you to take action and optimize its performance.

**Experimental Kubernetes Pods Status Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Pods Status dashboard* provides detailed information about the state and performance of your pods, including CPU, Memory, and Network metrics. 

This dashboard can help you quickly pinpoint any issues affecting your pods and ensure they continue to operate smoothly.

**Experimental Kubernetes Volume Dashboard**

*Kubernetes Volumes* dashboard  provides insights into your Kubernetes volumes, including capacity and usage, in real time. With this dashboard, you can easily monitor the performance and usage of your volumes and take proactive measures to ensure their performance.

Refer to the [documentation]() to learn more about these new experimental dashboards and how to use them.

Here are the steps to create a new folder and move all experimental dashboards to the new folder for quick access and internal use:

!!! note alert alert-primary "Note"
    You should have at least an *Editor* role to create a new folder and move all experimental dashboards.

1.	Navigate to the **Main** menu and hover on the {{icon.dashboards}} _Dashboards_ icon.
2.	Click **New folder**.
3.	Provide a name for your folder, and then select **Create**.
4.	Navigate to {{icon.dashboards}} _Dashboards_ from the **Main** menu and click **Browse**.
5.  Select the dashboard that you want to move and click **Move**.
6.	On the **Choose Dashboard** dialogue box, from the dropdown under **Folder** option, choose the folder where you want to move the dashboard.
7.	To apply your changes, select **Save Dashboard**.

## Components upgrade

VictoriaMetrics has been upgraded to version [1.89.1].

## New Features

- [PMM-10913](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10913) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, you can use an external PostgreSQL server as data storage for PMM. Thus, even if PMM fails, your data will be stored in an external source, reducing the risk associated with data loss. Furthermore, clustered PostgreSQL instances also enhance performance.

- [PMM-11281](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11281) - We have written a query for the postgres exporter to deal with lock conflicts in databases that block several transactions, thus impacting performance. With this query, you can find the PID of the blocking session and how many sessions it blocked. The proactive approach enables customers to address non-responsive databases quickly by understanding the underlying causes.

- [PMM-11384](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11384) and [PMM-11834](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11834) - PMM 2.37.0 now supports PSMDB operator versions 1.13 and 1.14.

- [PMM-11438](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11438) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, PMM administrators can disable the internal PostgreSQL server, which helps to fine-tune the server.

- [PMM-11439](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11439) - Starting with PMM 2.37.0, a PMM administrator can now view metrics from an external PostgreSQL server.


## Improvements

- [PMM-11412](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11412) - We have enhanced our dashboards to be more user-oriented, displaying the DB cluster's status along with its components, such as metrics of stateful, pods, and so on. Also, you can apply filters based on DB name or DB type.
- [PMM-11832](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11832) - When hovering over the **Backup** option on the main menu, PMM now displays the subcategories for easier navigation.
- [PMM-11522](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11522) - With the newly added support for Clickhouse as a datasource for Advisors, Advisors can now use data produced by Query Analytics (QAN) to run checks on databases.
- [PMM-11544](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11544) - Improved functionality for EXPLAIN query in QAN.
- [PMM-11926](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11926) - Updated the format of the **Upgrade to a Premium plan** URL on the **Advisor Insights** page. 
- [PMM-11078](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-11078) - Following the replacement of Integrated Alerting with Percona Alerting in PMM 2.311, we have now phased out all the APIs related to this deprecated feature.
