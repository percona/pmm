Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- PMM 1 vs. 2 Parity

    **Disable collectors during adding node/service to monitoring**

    With this feature users can disable any collector used by PMM to get metrics. When metrics cannot be collected or are no longer needed, disabling the collector(s) prevents PMM from flooding logs and saves infrastructure resources.

    Our vision for PMM collectors is to provide “stop from collecting” functionality to prevent possible harm to the user environment. This “disable” feature is an initial step towards the ideal functionality. The full and flexible management for “What metrics to collect and in what resolution” is slated for future releases.

    **External services monitoring**

    Since PMM 1.4.0, users had the ability to monitor external services Percona didn’t currently support (e.g., Redis). [This blog article from 2018](https://www.percona.com/blog/2018/02/12/percona-monitoring-management-pmm-support-external-monitoring-services-yes/) nicely described external services monitoring at that time. (At that time Percona was not natively supporting a PostgreSQL monitoring service and so this was listed as an external service. Today, PostgreSQL is natively supported by PMM.)

    Until now, PMM 2.x didn’t support external services monitoring. With this release, any non-natively supported by PMM service will now become supported with external services monitoring. You can see the list of possible exporters to be used in <https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/>. Natively-supported services will continue to deliver an expanded set of metrics and insights.

    **Provide summary information for  systems (`pt-*-summary actions`)**

    With the addition of `pt-*-summary` in PMM 2, users can now view summary information about services and nodes on PMM’s dashboard. This summary information is in the industry common format of `pt-*-summary` tools output to simplify portability of this data. This format will also be preserved in the snapshot of the dashboard shared with Percona Support to simplify investigations of issues.

    Note: `pt-*-summary` includes formats for:

    - `pt-mysql-summary`
    - `pt-mongodb-summary`
    - `pt-pg-summary`
    - `pt-summary`

- HAProxy support by PMM

    Users are able to add HAProxy Services for monitoring in PMM2. The support level of them in PMM will be the same we have for ProxySQL, so they will be presented in Inventory and on Dashboard. This will allow users who use HAProxy in their HA configuration to also have this component monitored by PMM. In future releases PMM will start use HAProxy by default for the DBaaS feature and will also use this functionality to monitor HAProxy.

- DBaaS Preview improvements (Technical  Preview)

    From now you will be able to see the progress of internal steps the system makes when executing some operations with DBaaS. The Progress Bar will not be time-related and will present only steps. The Progress Bar component will also reflect the K8s/Operator-related errors to the user, so in the case of errors, you will have the error text on the UI, and no need to use K8s tools to see the error. With the same UI, you will be able to see the latest logs from K8s so they will have even more information about why the error happened.

    Known Limitations: The progress bar will not provide valuable information for the Delete operation (will be in a later version when we’ll change the API with Operators Team), Operation of DB Cluster Modification will have “strange” behavior and will start changes from non-zero values of steps. (This will be modified after API changes.)

## Improvements

- [PMM-4679](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4679): Docker: `:latest` tag for `pmm-server` and `pmm-client` images has been moved from v1 latest release to v2 latest release.  **Note**: use of the latest tag is not recommended in production environments, instead use `:2` tag.
- [PMM-7472](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7472): Remove Prometheus data source -- If you were using custom dashboards with a specified data source (not using empty to use default one) you may need to edit your dashboards to use the proper data source. PMM is no longer using Prometheus but uses compatible storage for metrics from VictoriaMetrics. We renamed the data source to be more technology-agnostic.
- [PMM-6695](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6695): Software update: Grafana 7.1.3 to 7.3.7 (See [What's new in Grafana 7.2](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v7-2) and [What's new in Grafana 7.3](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/whatsnew/whats-new-in-v7-3/).)
- [PMM-7471](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7471): Software update: VictoriaMetrics 1.52.0 to 1.53.1 (See [VictoriaMetrics 1.53.0](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.53.0) and [VictoriaMetrics 1.53.1](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/releases/tag/v1.53.1).)
- [PMM-6693](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-6693): API keys usage -- PMM users can now use API keys (generated in Grafana UI) for interaction with PMM server instead of username/password pairs. The API key should have the same level of access (Admin or Viewer) as is required for username/password pairs.
- [PMM-7240](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7240): DBaaS: Change from Dashboard to Grafana Page -- We changed the DBaaS page from a Grafana Dashboard to a Grafana Page to be better aligned with the DBaaS enable/disable status and avoid confusion when DBaaS is disabled.
- [PMM-7328](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7328): Security Threat Tool: Download and run checks when activated, immediately, repeating every 24 hours thereafter (Previously, downloading and running new checks happened every 24 hours but the cycle didn't begin when STT was activated.)
- [PMM-7329](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7329): Security Threat Tool: Hide check results tab if STT is disabled.

- [PMM-7259](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-7259): Integrated Alerting: Better UI error reporting for disabled Integrated Alerting. (Hint to users how to enable it.)
- [PMM-5533](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5533): Better indentation of columns in `pmm-admin list` output.
- [PMM-5888](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5888): Improve `pmm-admin --help` descriptions for external services.
