Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    We recommend using the latest version of PMM. This ensures that you have access to the latest PMM features and that your environment runs on the latest version of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place.

## Release Highlights


#### New Experimental dashboards

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    These experimental dashboards are subject to change. It is recommended to use these dashboards for testing purposes only.

- We have introduced a more user-friendly and insightful experimental Home Dashboard in PMM version 2.30.0. With this new Home Dashboard, you can experience a boost in performance while monitoring a large number of nodes or services in PMM. Repeated rows (for a large number of nodes) on the dashboard can take a considerable time to load the Home Dashboard UI. </br>
  Our new experimental dashboard ensures fast retrieval of data on the Home Dashboard. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-home-experimental.html).

- We have introduced the following new real-time experimental dashboards to collect more metrics and data for MongoDB:

    - **Experimental MongoDB Collection Overview**
        
        This dashboard contains panels for data about the Hottest Collections in the MongoDB database. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-experimental_collection_overview.html). 

    - **Experimental MongoDB Collection Details**

        This experimental dashboard provides detailed information about the top collections by document count, size, and document read for MongoDB databases. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-experimental_collection_details.html).

    - **Experimental MongoDB Oplog Details**

        This real-time dashboard contains Oplog details such as Recovery Window, Processing Time, Buffer Capacity, and Oplog Operations. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/details/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-experimental_oplog.html).


### Database as a Service (DBaaS)

Enhanced the user experience by simplifying the configuration and deployment of DBaaS database clusters:

- With PMM 2.30.0, you can add a DB cluster literally at the click of a button. All the fields will be automatically populated with the default value. Click *Register*, and your DB cluster is added. For more information, see [documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-monitoring-and-management/using/dbaas.html#add-a-one-click-db-cluster).

- Starting with PMM 2.30.0, we have simplified the DBaaS configuration and deployment of database clusters by providing suggestions on the k8s cluster name based on the kubeconfig file.

- We have simplified DBaaS and Percona Platform connection configuration by suggesting and automatically setting the public address of the PMM server if it's not set up. This happens when connecting to Percona Platform, adding a Kubernetes (K8s) cluster, or adding a DB cluster.


### Operators support

PMM now supports Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster (1.11).



## New Features

- [PMM-9652](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9652): Dashboard: New experimental dashboards for MongoDB are now available with more MongoDB metrics and data like Hottest collections, Data Size, Recovery Window, Processing Time, Buffer Capacity, Oplog Operations, and so on.

- [PMM-10367](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10367): Dashboard: We have introduced a new user-friendly and insightful experimental Home Dashboard in PMM version 2.30.0. This Home Dashboard improves the performance while monitoring a large number of nodes or services in PMM.

- [PMM-10327](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10327):  You can add a free K8s cluster via Percona Platform Portal and use it for testing DBaaS in PMM. Read more in the [Private DBaaS with Free Kubernetes Cluster blogpost](https://www.percona.com/blog/private-dbaas-with-free-kubernetes-cluster/).

    
    !!! note alert alert-primary ""
        This feature will be available on https://portal.percona.com/ with the PMM 2.30.0 GA release.

 
## Improvements

- [PMM-10340](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10340): DBaaS: Enhanced user experience to simplify DBaaS configuration and deployment of Database clusters with suggestions on k8s cluster name based on k8s config file.
  
- [PMM-10368](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10368): Simpler DBaaS and Percona Platform connection configuration by suggesting the public address of the PMM server.

- [PMM-5680](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5680): Logs: For an enhanced and simplified troubleshooting experience, we have added the following logs in a ZIP file in the **pmm-agent** directory, which you can obtain from the pmm-admin summary command:

    - exporter logs
    - qan agent logs
    - pmm-agent log

- [PMM-5492](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5492): Logs: We have added the profiling data files to the logs directory to boost the troubleshooting process. You can obtain this by executing the `pmm-admin summary --pprof` command.

- [PMM-5005](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5005): Logs: Added a more pronounced error message for the PMM agent to help you distinguish between potential problems, such as connectivity issues, unconfigured agent issues, connection time-out issues, etc.


- [PMM-10147](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10147): To minimize resource consumption and DB connections, we have limited the number of concurrent jobs and actions that PMM Agent can execute concurrently. By default, PMM Agent will now run maximum 32 jobs and actions in parralel. You can configure this limit with the flag `--runner-capacity=<some number>` or environment variable `PMM_AGENT_RUNNER_CAPACITY=<some number>`. 


  
- [PMM-9914](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9914): PMM generates config files into the `/tmp` directory when a service is added to monitoring. Files in `/tmp` can get deleted by the Operating system. With PMM 2.30.0, we have ensured that the pmm-agent successfully restarts the child agents even though the config files in the  `/tmp`  directory are deleted and the scraper/exporter processes are killed, thereby ensuring that the exporter is not broken.

    
- [PMM-9994](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9994): QAN: Improved the description of the QAN filter in the user guide for better clarity.

- [PMM-9632](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9632): For flexibility, we have added the ability to change some of the pg_stat_monitor settings. Previously, this was hardcoded.

- [PMM-10122](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10122): Applied the pmm-agent `--log-level` to the exporter's output so that each message from the exporter with `log-level=WARN` will be logged in pmm-agent with the same `log-level=WARN`.

- [PMM-9921](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9921): Migrated pmm2-client Docker image to ubi-micro to reduce the number of packages and the image size.

- [PMM-10085](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10085): Support for Percona XtraDB Cluster (PXC) 1.11.0 in PMM.

- [PMM-10351](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-10351): DBaaS: Full form of DBaaS (Database as a Service) is displayed on the Dashboard for clarity for the new users.
