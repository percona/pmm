Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## New Features

- [PMM-5042](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5042) and [PMM-5272](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5272): PMM can now connect to MySQL instances by specifying a UNIX socket. This can be done with a new `--socket` option of the `pmm-admin add mysql` command. (Note: Updates to both PMM Client and PMM Server were done to allow UNIX socket connections.)
- [PMM-4145](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4145): Amazon RDS instance metrics can now be independently enabled/disabled for Basic and/or Enhanced metrics.

## Improvements

- [PMM-5581](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5581): PMM Server Grafana plugins can now be updated on the command line with the `grafana-cli` command-line utility.
- [PMM-5536](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5536): Three Grafana plugins were updated to the latest versions: `vertamedia-clickhouse-datasource` to 1.9.5, `grafana-polystat-panel` to 1.1.0, and `grafana-piechart-panel` to 1.4.0.
- [PMM-4252](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4252): The resolution of the PMM Server `favicon` image has been improved.

## Bugs Fixed

- [PMM-5547](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5547): PMM dashboards were failing when presenting data from more than 100 monitored instances (error message `proxy error: context canceled`).
- [PMM-5624](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5624): Empty charts were being shown in some Node Temperature dashboards.
- [PMM-5637](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5637): The Data retention value in Settings was incorrectly showing the value as minutes instead of days.
- [PMM-5613](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5613): Sorting data by Query Time was not working properly in Query Analytics.
- [PMM-5554](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5554): Totals in charts were inconsistently plotted with different colors across charts.
- [PMM-4919](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-4919): The force option (`--force`) in `pmm-admin config` was not always working.
- [PMM-5351](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-5351): The documentation on MongoDB user privileges has been corrected.
