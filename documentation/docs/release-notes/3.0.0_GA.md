Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations—regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release summary
PMM 3.0.0 introduces this and that


## Release highlights

### Finalized Integrated Alerting deprecation and API removal

This release completes the deprecation of Integrated Alerting started in PMM 2.31 by removing its remaining components and APIs:

- Removed all Integrated Alerting API endpoints, including `/v1/Settings/TestEmailAlertingSettings`
- Removed Integrated Alerting-related fields from the PMM Settings API (`email_alerting_settings` and `slack_alerting_settings`)

If you still have alert rules that haven't been migrated to Percona Alerting, use the [Integrated Alerting Migration Script](https://github.com/percona/pmm/blob/main/ia_migration.py) to migrate them. [Percona Alerting](../alert/index.md) provides enhanced capabilities through Grafana's alerting infrastructure and pre-configured Alert Rule Templates.
