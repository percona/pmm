Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operationsâ€”regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

### Removal of Integrated Alerting

This release removes what was known as "Integrated Alerting" in PMM 2.x. This feature was based on Grafana's built-in alerting system and was replaced by Percona Alerting in PMM 3.x.

Percona Alerting is a more powerful and flexible alerting system that leverages Grafana's advanced alerting capabilities and provides pre-configured Alert Rule Templates that simplify creating powerful alerting rules.

This change has required the removal of the **Alertmanager** configuration page in PMM Settings and a minor change in API:

- `/v1/Settings/TestEmailAlertingSettings` endpoint was removed from API
- `email_alerting_settings` and `slack_alerting_settings` fields were removed from the PMM settings API endpoint, which is now `/v1/server/settings`

For more information about Percona Alerting, see [About Percona Alerting](../alert/index.md).
