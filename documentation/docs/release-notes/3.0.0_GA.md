Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations—regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## Release highlights

## Improvements

- [PMM-12644](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12644) - We have enhanced PMM's container management by transitioning from data containers to Docker volumes to store data in the `/srv` directory. This means your data is no longer locked to specific container images and you can more easily manage storage with the `docker volume ls` command. 

The [Easy-install script](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/baremetal/docker/easy-install.md) now uses Docker volumes as the default storage method. For more information, see [Install PMM Server with Docker container](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/baremetal/docker/index.md.)

## Fixed issues

- [PMM-13360](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13360) - Fixed an issue in the MongoDB ReplSet Summary dashboard where nodes in `down` state would sometimes disappear from the **States** panel and their version information would be removed from the MongoDB Versions panel. Nodes in `down` state now remain visible with their last known version information preserved.
