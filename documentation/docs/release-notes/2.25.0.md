Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important note for users considering docker way upgrade to PMM 2.25.0"
    If you upgrade from a PMM version less than or equal to 2.23.0 using docker, it will fail if your PMM does not have external access (access to `repo. percona.com`). Thus, it is recommended to upgrade to PMM 2.26.0 instead. See [PMM-9416](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9416) for more details.


## Release Highlights
- **Percona Platform (Technology Preview):**
    - Connect Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) to [Percona Platform](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-platform) to boost the monitoring capabilities of your PMM installations and access all your Percona accounts and services from one single, centralized location. For more information, see the [Percona Platform Portal documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-platform/connect-pmm.html)



- **Enhanced PostgreSQL monitoring**
    - You can now [specify custom database names](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/commands/pmm-admin.html#postgresql) when adding PostgreSQL Servers for monitoring. Previous PMM versions always used the default `postgres` name instead.


    -  Added support for the new version of `pg_stat_monitor` extension. [Release Candidate v1.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/releases/tag/1.0.0-rc.1) brings many new PostgreSQL metrics, Dashboards and Query Analytics! To find out about all the features available in the new `pg_stat_monitor` version, see the [pg_stat_monitor User guide](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor/blob/1.0.0-rc.1/docs/USER_GUIDE.md)


    - Added compatibility for the latest Percona Distributions for PostgreSQL [14](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/LATEST/release-notes-v14.1.upd2.html), [13](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/13/release-notes-v13.5.upd2.html), [12](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/12/release-notes-v12.8.upd.html), [11](https://www.percona.com/doc/postgresql/11/release-notes-v11.13.upd.html) updated on December 7, 2021, which includes the newest version of the `pg_stat_monitor` extension.




- **Grafana usability enhancements**
    - PMM is now using the native Grafana provisioning mechanism for adding dashboards, plug-ins, and data sources. This ensures faster and more reliable upgrading to newer PMM versions.
Your existing plug-ins and dashboard changes are preserved during upgrades, but always make sure to back them up before upgrading and check that everything transferred correctly afterward.


    - Added option to change the time zone on dashboards. This selection is preserved while you navigate over Dashboards. If you need to change this setting permanently for your account, change it in your preferences by the URL: `https://YOUR_PMM_SERVER/graph/profile`


- **DBaaS (Technical Preview)**
    - You can now deploy and update your DBaaS created PXC clusters to the latest version of Percona Distribution for MySQL Operator 1.9.0. This enables you to take advantage of the latest features and fixes.


- **PMM environment enhancements**
     - The pmm-client docker container can now be started as a sidecar.  For users that use PMM client in Kubernetes or build automation around it, you can now start the client as a sidecar container simply by passing a flag.  The client will also gracefully handle any instances where the connection to DB  is not available. For more details, see the [PMM Client documentation](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/client/index.html#install)

    - Removed support for Ubuntu 16.04. With the support of new products and new versions of already supported products, we also removed old, unsupported software. As of this release, we are no longer supporting Ubuntu 16.04 in PMM [according to recent announcements](https://www.percona.com/blog/eol-pmmv1-mongo40-ubuntu1604)

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important note for users of PMM 2.24.0"
    2.24.0 AMI image has only 8GB available for the data, it is a bug (see [PMM-9298](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9298)). To resize a disk to full size you need to login to AMI instance with SSH and use the following command:

    ```sh
    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm-update/main/ansible/playbook/tasks/create-lvm.yml -o lvn-fix.yml && sudo ansible-playbook lvn-fix.yml
    ```

    For instructions about how to access your instances by using an SSH client, see [Connecting to Your Linux Instance Using SSH](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/setting-up/server/aws.html#:~:text=Connecting%20to%20Your%20Linux%20Instance%20Using%20SSH)
    Make sure to replace the user name ec2-user used in this document with admin.

    What this command does:

    1. Downloads Ansible playbook and runs it
    2. Copy your data from /srv to the temporary directory
    3. Create lvm partition
    4. Copy data from system disk to a new LVM partition

## Known issues
- [PMM-9255](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9255): After connecting PMM to Percona Platform, PMM occasionally shows a false permission issue notification, incorrectly suggesting that the connection could not be established due to missing permissions. Reload the page to remove the incorrect notification and confirm the connection.
- [PMM-9312](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9312): It's not possible to enable `collStats`, `indexStats` and `-max-collections-limit` for MongoDB
