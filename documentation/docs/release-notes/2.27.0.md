Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    We recommend using the latest version of the PMM instance. This ensures that you access the latest features of the underlying components, such as VictoriaMetrics, with all the bug fixes in place. One of the critical features of VictoriaMetrics is [stream parsing mode](https://docs.victoriametrics.com/vmagent.html#stream-parsing-mode), which enhances the performance of PMM and saves memory when scraping targets expose millions of metrics.

## Release Highlights

### PMM and Percona Portal Integration

- **Enhanced UX for connecting PMM server to Percona Portal**

    To leverage Percona Platform's recent support for federated identity, PMM now uses access-token authorization for connecting PMM instances to Percona Platform. 

    This replaces the former username/password authentication used in PMM 2.26.0 and older versions.

    For more information, see [Integrate PMM with Percona Platform](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/how-to/integrate-platform.html). 

-  **Access to account information for Percona customers**
  
      When you connect your PMM instances to Percona Platform as a Percona customer, you can now check all your Percona Platform account information on the new **Entitlements** and **Support Tickets** tab on the main menu.      
  
    For more information, see [Check your account information](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/how-to/account-info.html) in the online Help.

### Advisors

- **Broader database health assessments with Advisors**

    With this release, we are renaming Security Checks to Advisors and grouping them according to the functionality and recommendations they provide. To reflect these changes, the old **Security Threat Tool** option is now called **Advisors**.
  
    In addition, we have added new checks for MySQL and MongoDB.
     To check the list of checks and the tier for which they are available, see [Advisor checks for PMM](https://docs.percona.com/percona-platform/checks.html) in the Percona Platform online Help.

- **New Paid tier and special Advisor checks for customers**
  
    In addition to Registered Checks, Percona customers who connect PMM to Percona Platform now also have access to Paid Advisor checks, which offer more advanced database health information.
 
    For more information, see [Working with Advisor checks](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/how-to/advisors.html).

- Advisor checks have been extended with two new query types: `GetDiagnosticData` and `replSetGetStatus`.

- Improved the documentation around [developing checks](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-monitoring-and-management/2.x/details/checks/index.html).

Simplified experience in registering EKS cluster with kubeconfig generated by `eksctl`.

## Known Issues

[PMM-9992](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-9992): **Error while using reverse proxy (like Nginx)**

While using a reverse proxy (for example, Nginx) in front of PMM, you can run into the error `origin not allowed` after upgrading to PMM 2.27.0 or newer versions.

**Solution**

Add the `Host` header to the reverse proxy configuration file.

**Example** 

For Nginx, add the following:

`proxy_set_header Host $http_host;`
