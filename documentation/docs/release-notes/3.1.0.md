Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud


## Enhanced permission control for Advisors

Users with Editor roles can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This improvement is especially beneficial for managed service environments where Admin access is restricted to database administrators. 

While Editor role users can view insights, they cannot run, disable, or edit Advisors, nor can they run checks. These actions remain restricted to Admin users. Viewer role users continue to have no access to advisors. 

## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.


- [PMM-13315](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13315) - 


## Fixed issues
- [PMM-13693](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM) - Corrected an issue on the **Updates** page where the list of PMM Clients didn't sort by **Status** column correctly when managing a mix of PMM 2.x and PMM 3 Clients after an upgrade from PMM 2.
