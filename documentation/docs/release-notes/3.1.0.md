Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud


## Enhanced permission control for Advisors and Alerts

We've refined role-based access for Advisors and Alerts, making it easier for teams to collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

### Advisors access for Editors

Users with the Editor role can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This is especially beneficial in managed service environments where Admin access is typically restricted to database administrators.

While Editors can view Advisors insights, only Admin users have the ability to run, disable, or edit Advisors and execute checks.

### Expanded access to fired alerts

The **Fired Alerts** tab is now accessible to both Viewer and Editor roles, allowing teams to monitor triggered Alert Rules without needing elevated permissions.

- Editors can now silence alerts and fully manage Alert Templates (view, create, edit, and delete).
- Viewers have read-only access to alerts and cannot access Alert Templates.

For more details, see [PMM roles and permissions](../admin/roles/index.md).

## Enhanced permission control for Advisors

Users with Editor roles can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This improvement is especially beneficial for managed service environments where Admin access is restricted to database administrators. 

While Editor role users can view insights, they cannot run, disable, or edit Advisors, nor can they run checks. These actions remain restricted to Admin users. Viewer role users continue to have no access to advisors.

## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.
