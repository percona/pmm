- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud

## Release highlights

### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) by restoring and refining the **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This section now correctly organizes and displays MongoDB cluster components—including shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their respective sections, ensuring a clear hierarchical structure. Previously, all components were incorrectly grouped under the Config Services section.

This enhancement provides a more accurate and intuitive visualization of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it easier to understand, monitor, and manage the relationships between its components:

## Improvements to MongoDB monitoring

We've made MongoDB monitoring more accurate and user-friendly based on your feedback! The **MongoDB ReplicaSet Summary** and the **MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary**  now offer clearer insights at a glance. Here's what's better:

- Improved node state detection to accurately show when nodes are down.
- Refined **Top Hottest Collections** to only highlight the most relevant data.
- Rounded numbers in Overview panels for better readability
- More precise numbers (showing tenths) in **Top Hottest Collections** panels
- Fixed display issues in **Disk I/O** and **Network traffic** panels for more reliable performance monitoring
