Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud

## Release highlights


### Enhanced permission control for Advisors and Alerts

We've refined role-based access for Advisors and Alerts, making it easier for teams to collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

#### Advisors access for Editors

Users with the Editor role can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This is especially beneficial in managed service environments where Admin access is typically restricted to database administrators.

While Editors can view Advisors insights, only Admin users have the ability to run, disable, or edit Advisors and execute checks.

#### Expanded access to fired alerts

The **Fired Alerts** page under **Alerting** is now accessible to both Viewer and Editor roles, allowing teams to monitor triggered alerts without needing elevated permissions:

- Editors can now view and silence alerts directly from the **Fired alerts** page. Previously, silencing alerts was only possible via the **Alert rules** page.
- Editors also gain full access to alert templates including the ability to view, create, edit, and delete templates.
- Viewers cannot access or modify alert templates, ensuring security over critical alert configurations.

For more details, see [PMM roles and permissions](../admin/roles/index.md).

### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) by restoring and refining the **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This section now correctly organizes and displays MongoDB cluster components—including shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their respective sections, ensuring a clear hierarchical structure. Previously, all components were incorrectly grouped under the Config Services section.

This enhancement provides a more accurate and intuitive visualization of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it easier to understand, monitor, and manage the relationships between its components:

### Extended metrics and labels for MongoDB Query Analytics (QAN)

We've added new metrics and filters to the [QAN dashboard](../use/qan/index.md) that expose important query execution details to highlight inefficient execution paths and provide detailed lock and storage metrics. With the new filters, you can easily identify problematic queries by application, client, or user:

#### Additional MongoDB QAN metrics
The **Query Details** section of the QAN dashboard now includes these additional metrics:

- **Docs Examined**: number of examined documents during query execution
- **Keys Examined**: number of index keys scanned during query execution
- **Docs Returned**: number of returned documents by the query
- **Response Length**: size of the response in bytes
- **Locks Global Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a global read lock was acquired during query execution
- **Locks Global Acquire Count Write Shared**: number of times a global write lock was acquired during query execution
- **Locks Database Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock was acquired at the database level during query execution
- **Locks Database Acquire Wait Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock at the database level was requested but had to wait before being granted
- **Locks Database Time Acquiring Micros Read Shared**: indicates the time spent acquiring a read lock at the database level during an operation
- **Locks Collection Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock was acquired on a specific collection during operations
- **Storage Bytes Read**: total number of bytes read from storage during a specific operation
- **Storage Time Reading Micros**: indicates the time spent reading data from storage during an operation

#### New MongoDB QAN filter categories

The QAN dashboard now includes several additional MongoDB-specific filter options:

- **Plan Summary**: filters queries by execution plan type (COLLSCAN, IXSCAN, etc.) to easily identify inefficient full collection scans
- **Application Name**: filters queries by the application name that generated them
- **User**: filters queries by the database user who executed the query
- **Database**: filters queries by specific database



## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.

- [PMM-12242](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12242) - Expanded alert visibility allowing Viewers to see fired alerts and Editors to manage alerts from the Fired Alerts page.

- [PMM-12356](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12356) - Enabled Editor role users to view Advisors insights while maintaining Admin-only control over running and modifying them.

- [PMM-13315](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13315) -
