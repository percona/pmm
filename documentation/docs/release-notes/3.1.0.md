Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud

## Release highlights

### Improvements to MongoDB monitoring

#### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) with an enhanced **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This redesigned section now properly categorizes MongoDB cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their appropriate hierarchical sections. This replaces the previous implementation where all components were incorrectly grouped under the Config Services section.

The enhanced visualization provides a clearer representation of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it simpler to understand relationships between components:

#### Enhanced filtering capabilities 
We've improved the filtering experience on the [MongoDB Instances Compare](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-instances-compare.md) dashboard with four new selection boxes in addition to the existing **Service Name** filter:

- **Replication Set**: filters instances by their replication set
- **Environment**: filters instances by environment
- **Cluster**: filters instances by cluster
- **Node**: filters instances by node name

These additional filters make it easier to navigate and compare MongoDB instances in larger environments, allowing you to quickly narrow down the specific instances you want to monitor without relying solely on service names.

#### Enhanced MongoDB dashboard visualizations
Based on community feedback, we've improved the monitoring experience in both the [MongoDB ReplicaSet Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-replset-summary.md) and the [MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) dashboards. These improvements deliver more accurate and actionable insights:

- Enhanced node state detection for reliable identification of down nodes
- Optimized **Top Hottest Collections** panel showing only the most critical data
- Improved readability with rounded numbers in **Overview** panels
- Added precision with decimal values (tenths) in **Top Hottest Collections** panels
- Resolved visualization issues in **Disk I/O** and **Network traffic** panels for more reliable performance monitoring
