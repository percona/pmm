## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.


- [PMM-13315](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13315) -
