## Release highlights

### Extended metrics and labels for MongoDB Query Analytics (QAN)

We've added new metrics and filters to the [QAN dashboard](../use/qan/index.md) that expose important query execution details to highlight inefficient execution paths and provide detailed lock and storage metrics. With the new filters, you can easily identify problematic queries by application, client, user or even plan summary:

#### Additional MongoDB QAN metrics
The **Query Details** section of the QAN dashboard now includes these additional metrics:

- **Docs Examined**: number of examined documents during query execution
- **Keys Examined**: number of index keys scanned during query execution
- **Docs Returned**: number of returned documents by the query
- **Response Length**: size of the response in bytes
- **Locks Global Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a global read lock was acquired during query execution
- **Locks Global Acquire Count Write Shared**: number of times a global write lock was acquired during query execution
- **Locks Database Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock was acquired at the database level during query execution
- **Locks Database Acquire Wait Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock at the database level was requested but had to wait before being granted
- **Locks Database Time Acquiring Micros Read Shared**: indicates the time spent acquiring a read lock at the database level during an operation
- **Locks Collection Acquire Count Read Shared**: number of times a read lock was acquired on a specific collection during operations
- **Storage Bytes Read**: total number of bytes read from storage during a specific operation
- **Storage Time Reading Micros**: indicates the time spent reading data from storage during an operation

#### New MongoDB QAN filter categories

The QAN dashboard now includes several additional MongoDB-specific filter options:

- **Plan Summary**: filters queries by execution plan type (COLLSCAN, IXSCAN, etc.) to easily identify inefficient full collection scans
- **Application Name**: filters queries by the application name that executed them
- **User**: filters queries by the database user who executed the query
- **Database**: filters queries by specific database

### Improvements to MongoDB monitoring
#### Enhanced permission control for Advisors and Alerts

We've refined role-based access for Advisors and Alerts, making it easier for teams to collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

##### Advisors access for Editors

Users with the Editor role can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This is especially beneficial in managed service environments where Admin access is typically restricted to database administrators.

While Editors can view Advisors insights, only Admin users have the ability to run, disable, or edit Advisors and execute checks.

##### Expanded access to fired alerts

The **Fired Alerts** page under **Alerting** is now accessible to both Viewer and Editor roles, allowing teams to monitor triggered alerts without needing elevated permissions:

- Editors can now view and silence alerts directly from the **Fired alerts** page. Previously, silencing alerts was only possible via the **Alert rules** page.
- Editors also gain full access to alert templates including the ability to view, create, edit, and delete templates.
- Viewers cannot access or modify alert templates, ensuring security over critical alert configurations.

For more details, see [PMM roles and permissions](../admin/roles/index.md).

#### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) with an enhanced **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This redesigned section now properly categorizes MongoDB cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their appropriate hierarchical sections. This replaces the previous implementation where all components were incorrectly grouped under the **Config Servers** section.

The enhanced visualization provides a clearer representation of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it simpler to understand relationships between components:

#### Enhanced filtering capabilities 
We've improved the filtering experience on the [MongoDB Instances Compare](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-instances-compare.md) dashboard with four new selection boxes in addition to the existing **Service Name** filter:

- **Replication Set**: filters instances by their replication set
- **Environment**: filters instances by environment
- **Cluster**: filters instances by cluster
- **Node**: filters instances by node name

These additional filters make it easier to navigate and compare MongoDB instances in larger environments, allowing you to quickly narrow down the specific instances you want to monitor without relying solely on service names.

#### Enhanced MongoDB dashboard visualizations
Based on community feedback, we've improved the monitoring experience in both the [MongoDB ReplicaSet Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-replset-summary.md) and the [MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) dashboards. These improvements deliver more accurate and actionable insights:

- Enhanced node state detection for reliable identification of down nodes
- Optimized **Top Hottest Collections** panel showing only the most critical data
- Improved readability with rounded numbers in **Overview** panels
- Added precision with decimal values (tenths) in **Top Hottest Collections** panels
- Resolved visualization issues in **Disk I/O** and **Network traffic** panels for more reliable performance monitoring

## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.

- [PMM-12242](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12242) - Expanded alert visibility allowing Viewers to see fired alerts and Editors to manage alerts from the Fired Alerts page.

- [PMM-12356](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12356) - Enabled Editor role users to view Advisors insights while maintaining Admin-only control over running and modifying them.

- [PMM-13575](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13575) - The `mongodb_pbm_agent_status` metric in MongoDB exporter now includes a `self` label to differentiate between an agent reporting its own status versus reporting status of other agents in the cluster. The `self` label is set to `1` when the agent is reporting about itself, and to `0` when reporting about other agents. This helps identify more precisely which specific agent is experiencing problems without false positives on functioning nodes. 

- [PMM-13718](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13718) - Improved user access control to PMM logs. The PMM logs link in the Help menu is now hidden for users without administrative privileges instead of displaying an _**_Access denied_ error when accessed.

- [PMM-13676](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13676) - Redesigned all PMM email templates with PMM branding, replacing Grafana logos and styling. Alert emails now also include options for professional support services when needed.
 
## Fixed issues
- [PMM-13770](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13770) -  Updated metric calculation expressions to correctly capture service counts following changes in job name formatting in PMM3. The **Monitored DB services** panel on the **Home** dashboard now accurately reflects the number of monitored instances.
- [PMM-13769](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13769) - Users with non-Admin roles would see an "Access denied" error when downloading PMM logs. The PMM logs link is now properly hidden for users without administrative privileges, improving the user experience by only showing available options.
- [PMM-13715](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13715) - Fixed an issue where non-admin users would encounter access error messages after a PMM upgrade.  PMM now properly checks user roles before initiating configuration tasks, preventing unnecessary error messages for regular users.
- [PMM-13706](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13706) - Fixed an issue where the Grafana status panel on the **PMM Health** dashboard incorrectly displayed a **Down** state even when the Grafana service was running normally. Status indicators now accurately reflect the actual state of the service.
- [PMM-13698](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13706) - Fixed an issue where expanded service details under **Inventory > Services** would automatically collapse due to page reloads every 5 seconds. Service information now stays expanded, allowing for uninterrupted review.
- [PMM-13750](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13706) - Fixed excessive error logging in PostgreSQL monitoring by skipping table extraction from truncated queries, significantly reducing log volume in busy environments.
