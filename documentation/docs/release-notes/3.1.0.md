Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud

## Release highlights

### Improvements to MongoDB monitoring
### Enhanced permission control for Advisors and Alerts

We've refined role-based access for Advisors and Alerts, making it easier for teams to collaborate while maintaining security boundaries.

#### Advisors access for Editors

Users with the Editor role can now access Advisors insights without requiring Admin privileges. This is especially beneficial in managed service environments where Admin access is typically restricted to database administrators.

While Editors can view Advisors insights, only Admin users have the ability to run, disable, or edit Advisors and execute checks.

#### Expanded access to fired alerts

The **Fired Alerts** page under **Alerting** is now accessible to both Viewer and Editor roles, allowing teams to monitor triggered alerts without needing elevated permissions:

- Editors can now view and silence alerts directly from the **Fired alerts** page. Previously, silencing alerts was only possible via the **Alert rules** page.
- Editors also gain full access to alert templates including the ability to view, create, edit, and delete templates.
- Viewers cannot access or modify alert templates, ensuring security over critical alert configurations.

For more details, see [PMM roles and permissions](../admin/roles/index.md).

### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

#### Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) with an enhanced **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This redesigned section now properly categorizes MongoDB cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their appropriate hierarchical sections. This replaces the previous implementation where all components were incorrectly grouped under the **Config Servers** section.

The enhanced visualization provides a clearer representation of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it simpler to understand relationships between components:

#### Enhanced filtering capabilities 
We've improved the filtering experience on the [MongoDB Instances Compare](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-instances-compare.md) dashboard with four new selection boxes in addition to the existing **Service Name** filter:

- **Replication Set**: filters instances by their replication set
- **Environment**: filters instances by environment
- **Cluster**: filters instances by cluster
- **Node**: filters instances by node name

These additional filters make it easier to navigate and compare MongoDB instances in larger environments, allowing you to quickly narrow down the specific instances you want to monitor without relying solely on service names.

#### Enhanced MongoDB dashboard visualizations
Based on community feedback, we've improved the monitoring experience in both the [MongoDB ReplicaSet Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-replset-summary.md) and the [MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) dashboards. These improvements deliver more accurate and actionable insights:

- Enhanced node state detection for reliable identification of down nodes
- Optimized **Top Hottest Collections** panel showing only the most critical data
- Improved readability with rounded numbers in **Overview** panels
- Added precision with decimal values (tenths) in **Top Hottest Collections** panels
- Resolved visualization issues in **Disk I/O** and **Network traffic** panels for more reliable performance monitoring

## Improvements

- [PMM-12161](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12161) - Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization on the **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard. Cluster components—shards, config servers, and mongos routers—are now accurately organized into their respective dedicated sections. Previously, all components were displayed under the **Config Services** section, which caused confusion. This update provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of your MongoDB cluster structure, making it easier to understand and manage.

- [PMM-12242](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12242) - Expanded alert visibility allowing Viewers to see fired alerts and Editors to manage alerts from the Fired Alerts page.

- [PMM-12356](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12356) - Enabled Editor role users to view Advisors insights while maintaining Admin-only control over running and modifying them.

- [PMM-13575](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13575) - The `mongodb_pbm_agent_status` metric in MongoDB exporter now includes a `self` label to differentiate between an agent reporting its own status versus reporting status of other agents in the cluster. The `self` label is set to `1` when the agent is reporting about itself, and to `0` when reporting about other agents. This helps identify more precisely which specific agent is experiencing problems without false positives on functioning nodes.
