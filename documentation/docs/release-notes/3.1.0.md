## Release highlights

## Improved MongoDB cluster topology visualization

We have improved the [MongoDB Cluster Summary dashboard](../reference/dashboards/dashboard-mongodb-cluster-summary.md) by restoring and refining the **Current Topology** section, which had been available in older PMM 2 versions.

This section now correctly organizes and displays MongoDB cluster components—including shards, config servers, and mongos routers—within their respective sections, ensuring a clear hierarchical structure. Previously, all components were incorrectly grouped under the Config Services section.

This enhancement provides a more accurate and intuitive visualization of your MongoDB cluster architecture, making it easier to understand, monitor, and manage the relationships between its components:
