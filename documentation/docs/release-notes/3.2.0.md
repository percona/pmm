Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- troubleshoot issues effectively
- execute database management tasks seamlessly, whether your databases are on-premises or in the cloud

## Release summary

## Release highlights

### Native PMM Client support for Amazon Linux 2023
PMM 3.2.0 introduces official RPM package support for installing the PMM Client on Amazon Linux 2023. If you’ve been deploying PMM Client on AL2023 and relying on tarball-based installation workarounds, you no longer need to — you can now install the Client through native RPM packages.

This streamlines the setup process and integrates more seamlessly with your AL2023 environment, making it quicker and easier to get started with monitoring databases.

### Enhanced MySQL 8.4 support

PMM 3.2.0 completes our support for MySQL 8.4. While PMM 3.0.0 provided partial support with Query Analytics (QAN) and basic dashboard features, it couldn't monitor replication metrics due to MySQL 8.4's shift in exposing replication status from traditional status variables to `performance_schema` tables.

With this release, we've upgraded the MySQL Exporter to version 0.17.2, enabling it to collect replication metrics from both legacy status variables and the new `performance_schema` tables. We've also reconfigured the **MySQL Replication Summary** dashboard to display these metrics properly regardless of their source.

This means that PMM can now provide complete replication monitoring across all supported MySQL versions (5.7, 8.0, and 8.4), including critical metrics like IO Thread status, SQL Thread status, and Replication Lag.

### GSSAPI authentication support for MongoDB
You can now connect to MongoDB (and Percona Server for MongoDB) using the [GSSAPI authentication mechanism](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/control-access-to-mongodb-with-kerberos-authentication/), commonly used in Kerberos environments.

If you previously encountered errors when attempting to monitor MongoDB with GSSAPI (e.g., GSSAPI support not enabled during build), this update resolves the issue. You can now pass the appropriate GSSAPI credentials and connection parameters using pmm-admin, improving compatibility with secure enterprise environments that rely on Kerberos. For setup instructions, see the [PSMDB documentation](https://docs.percona.com/percona-server-for-mongodb/8.0/).

### Secure external ClickHouse connections 
PMM now supports connecting to external ClickHouse servers using authenticated credentials. You can now set the `PMM_CLICKHOUSE_USER` and `PMM_CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` environment variables when deploying PMM Server to enable access to password-protected ClickHouse instances, such as those managed by Altinity’s operator. This resolves previous authentication errors and removes the need to embed credentials in the address string.


### Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) panel in MongoDB dashboards
PMM now shows the current MongoDB Feature Compatibility Version (FCV) in the Replica Set and Cluster Summary dashboards. This helps you quickly see if your cluster is running the expected FCV—especially after upgrades, when the FCV might not match the MongoDB version yet.

### Improved Query Analytics filter performance
We've significantly improved Query Analytics (QAN) filter loading performance by optimizing the database queries that power the filter sidebar. The optimization reduced the number of processed rows by up to 95% in large environments, resulting in faster filter population and more responsive QAN interface.

## Improvements

- [PMM-13406](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13869)- We've integrated HashiCorp Nomad into PMM — a powerful workload orchestrator designed to improve resource allocation and enable future extensibility.
Nomad is disabled by default, and although the Docker image size has slightly increased, this additional footprint has no impact on performance when Nomad remains disabled.

    Initially, Nomad will assist with managing monitoring agents, enhancing service delivery for Percona customers, and providing a foundation for future feature development. For more information, see [Nomad configuration for Percona teams](../reference/nomad.md). 

- [PMM-13869](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13869) - PMM now outputs Nginx access logs in LOGFMT format, ensuring consistency across all PMM components. This also improves compatibility with log analysis tools like Loki and VictoriaLogs, which means that you can analyze logs directly without reformatting or manual parsing.

- [PMM-13939](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13939) - Improved the performance of a frequently used query in Query Analytics (QAN) by optimizing the number of rows fetched from the database. This change reduces the time it takes to display QAN filters, resulting in a smoother user experience.

- [PMM-13873](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13873) - Upgraded MySQL Exporter to the upstream version 0.17.2, which support MySQL version 8.4. “MySQL Replication Summary” and "MySQL Group Replication Summary" dashboards have been updated to support this version.

## Fixed issues

- [PMM-13770](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13770) - 
- [PMM-13780](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13780) - Fixed an issue in the SQL query parser that prevented group replication metrics from being collected. The **MySQL Group Replication Summary** dashboard now properly displays transaction and conflict metrics for MySQL 8.0 and 8.4 environments.
