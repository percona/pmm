## Release highlights



## Improvements

- [PMM-13406](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13869)- We've integrated HashiCorp Nomad into PMM â€” a powerful workload orchestrator designed to improve resource allocation and enable future extensibility.
Nomad is disabled by default, and although the Docker image size has increased slightly, this additional footprint has no impact on performance when Nomad remains disabled.

    Initially, Nomad will assist with managing monitoring agents, enhancing service delivery for Percona customers, and providing a foundation for future feature development. For more information, see [Nomad configuration for Percona teams](../reference/nomad.md). 

- [PMM-13869](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13869) - PMM now outputs Nginx access logs in LOGFMT format, ensuring consistency across all PMM components. This also improves compatibility with log analysis tools like Loki and VictoriaLogs, which means that you can analyze logs directly without reformatting or manual parsing.

- [PMM-13939](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13939) - We have improved the performance of a frequently used query in Query Analytics (QAN) by optimizing the number of rows fetched from the database. This change reduces the time it takes to display QAN filters, resulting in a smoother user experience.
