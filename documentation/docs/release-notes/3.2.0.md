## Release summary


## Release highlights

### Nomad integration in PMM
We've integrated HashiCorp Nomad into PMM — a powerful workload orchestrator designed to improve resource allocation and enable future extensibility.
Nomad is disabled by default, and although the Docker image size has increased slightly, this additional footprint has no impact on performance when Nomad remains disabled.

Initially, Nomad will assist with managing monitoring agents, enhancing service delivery for Percona customers, and providing a foundation for future feature development.

### Internal configuration (Percona team)
The following configuration details are primarily for Percona support teams:
To enable Nomad:

1. Start PMM Server with `-e PMM_ENABLE_NOMAD=1`.
2. Expose port `-p 4647:4647`.
3. Set the public address in **Advanced settings** in PMM UI
4. Restart PMM Server.

**Example**:

```sh
docker run -d \
  -e PMM_ENABLE_NOMAD=1 \
  -p 4647:4647 \
  -p 443:443 \
  --name pmm-server \
  percona/pmm-server:latest
  ```

To disable Nomad, use `-e PMM_ENABLE_NOMAD=0`.

### Client requirements

- PMM Client nodes must have the `iproute` package installed.
- Clients must have access to cgroups.
- You can verify Nomad’s availability by accessing: `https://<PMM_SERVER_URL>/nomad/v1/nodes`.


## Improvements

- [PMM-13869](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13869) - PMM now outputs Nginx access logs in LOGFMT format, ensuring consistency across all PMM components. This also improves compatibility with log analysis tools like Loki and VictoriaLogs, which means that you can analyze logs directly without reformatting or manual parsing.

## Fixed issues
