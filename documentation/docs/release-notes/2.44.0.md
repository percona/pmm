Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them, and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

    ## Updated Docker image labels for OpenShift compatibility

    We've published an update to this release that modifies the PMM Client Docker image labels (`vendor`, `maintainer`, and others) to meet Red Hat certification requirements.
    
    The PMM Client image update was required to ensure compatibility with [Percona Operator for MongoDB (PSMDB) Operator 1.19.0](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mongodb/RN/Kubernetes-Operator-for-PSMONGODB-RN1.19.0.html) and enables seamless deployment in OpenShift environments.

    This change only impacts the PMM Client image. OpenShift compatibility for PMM Server is planned for PMM v3.

## Support for version 8.0 of Percona Server for MongoDB (PSMDB), MongoDB Community, and MongoDB Enterprise

The latest version of MongoDB Community edition, along with the upcoming [PSMDB 8.0](https://www.percona.com/software/mongodb/percona-server-for-mongodb), introduce [numerous improvements and significant performance enhancements](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/release-notes/8.0/).

We have updated PMM 2 to include support for these new versions, including changes to `mongodb_exporter` to accommodate the revised metrics structure (e.g., `wiredTiger.concurrentTransactions` is now `queues.execution`).

The MongoDB **Oplog Details** dashboard has also been adapted to support MongoDB 8.0's new oplog metrics, with updated panels for **Oplog Buffered Operations** and **Buffer Capacity**.

!!! hint alert alert-success "Important notes"
    - This enhancement requires PMM Agent version 2.43.1 or later.

    - MongoDB 8.0 introduces significant changes to its internal metrics structure. While we have updated PMMâ€™s built-in dashboards to reflect these changes, you may need to update any custom dashboards to align with the new metrics.

    - When using the `--enable-all-collectors` flag, monitor memory usage carefully with MongoDB clusters, especially in sharded environments with multiple collections. If you frequently create new collections or work with many collections, disable the `collstats` collector to prevent memory consumption issues.

## Improved PostgreSQL 17 metrics collection

PMM 2.44.0 strengthens monitoring capabilities for PostgreSQL 17, building on the recent support for Query Analytics (QAN) introduced in PMM 2.43.2.

This previous release updated field names for PostgreSQL 17 compatibility (e.g., `blk_read_time` to `shared_blk_read_time`).

This release further enhances PostgreSQL monitoring with updated queries aligned with PostgreSQL 17's schema changes to ensure accurate metrics collection in the [PostgreSQL Instances Overview dashboard](../details/dashboards/dashboard-postgresql-instances-overview.md).

We've also improved collector support, including proper recognition of PostgreSQL 17 columns like `checkpoints_timed` in the `stat_bgwriter` collector.


## Fixed metrics collection for MongoDB backups

We've resolved an issue where Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) metrics were not being scraped by default and required the `--enable-all-collectors` flag.

With this fix, PBM metrics are now automatically collected when MongoDB services are added to PMM, without requiring additional configuration.

However, PBM metrics collection is disabled for PMM Clients 2.43.0 and 2.43.1 due to a memory leak identified in these versions. This functionality is supported starting with PMM Client 2.43.2 and later.
