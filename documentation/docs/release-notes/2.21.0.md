Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights:

- **Custom certificates support**: We have added support for custom TLS certificates for remote monitoring of PostgreSQL and MongoDB services, configurable on the command line with `pmm-admin` or through the UI.

- **Backup scheduling with retention** (Technical Preview): When scheduling a backup you can now specify how many of the most recent backups to keep. Backups not in this range are automatically deleted to free space for new ones.

- New supported versions:
    - DBaaS functionality now supports Kubernetes Operator for MongoDB version 1.9.0.
    - PMM Client packages now support Debian 11 ("Bullseye").

## New Features

## Known Issues

- Failure to upgrade when using a dashboard with custom tags.

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    In some cases users may not be able to complete the upgrade to 2.21.0 and we have linked this back to dashboards with custom tags.  This is to be fixed in our upcoming 2.22.0 release but there are steps (more in the [ticket](https://jira.percona.com/browse/PMM-8703)) that you can take if you're already impacted by this:

    ```
    curl -LJOs https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm-server/c2e92bc3aec123affda5f1992c96c95ac74f4a2d/import-dashboards.py
    docker cp import-dashboards.py pmm-server:/usr/share/percona-dashboards/
    docker exec -it pmm-server chmod a+x /usr/share/percona-dashboards/import-dashboards.py
    ```
