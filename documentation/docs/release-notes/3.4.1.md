## Fixed issues

- [PMM-14022](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14022):  Fixed duplicate service counts in MongoDB dashboards and the MongoDB down alert rule on the **Alert rules** page caused by high-resolution and low-resolution exporter jobs being counted separately.

- [PMM-14106](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14106): Fixed **MongoDB Command Operations** and **Collection Details** panels in **Replica Set Summary**, **Cluster Summary**, and **Router Summary** dashboards to correctly apply the node filter selection. The panels now display data only for the selected node instead of always showing all nodes.
