# Percona Monitoring and Management 3.4.1

**Release date**: October 8th 2025

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. PMM empowers you to:

- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- diagnose and resolve issues faster with actionable insights
- manage databases across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments

## Release summary

PMM 3.4.1 is a maintenance release that addresses several security vulnerabilities and updates Docker images and package dependencies.

### Fixed denial of service (DoS) in Nomad (CVE-2025-8959)
We've upgraded the integrated scheduling service to Nomad v1.10.5 to address a high-severity vulnerability (CVE-2025-8959). 

This issue existed in a Nomad SSH agent dependency and could be exploited to cause a Nomad client crash (DoS) when processing unexpected data types.

### Fixed denial of service (DoS) in Percona Toolkit (Logrus)
Upgraded Percona Toolkit to v3.7.0-2 to resolve a high-severity DoS vulnerability found in the dependency `github.com/sirupsen/logrus`. This flaw could crash Percona Toolkit commands and disrupt PMM data collection.

### Not affected: Remote code execution (RCE) in pypa/setuptools (CVE-2024-6345)

PMM is not affected by this RCE vulnerability. The PMM image's base OS, Oracle Linux 9, ships with `python3-setuptools 53.0.0-13.el9_6.1`, which already contains the necessary security patch, as verified against the [Oracle Linux 9 changelog](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2024-5534.html).

### Not affected: OpenSSL cipher processing vulnerability (CVE-2023-5363)
PMM is not affected by this OpenSSL cipher processing vulnerability. The `openssl-libs` package in the Oracle Linux 9 base OS already contains the security patch, as verified against the [Oracle Linux 9 changelog](https://linux.oracle.com/errata/ELSA-2024-0627.html).

### Accepted risk: Buffer overflow vulnerabilities in OpenSSL (CVE-2022-3786 and CVE-2022-3602)

These vulnerabilities affect the `openssl-libs` package included in our Oracle Linux 9 base image.

Oracle has released patches for these vulnerabilities, but they are distributed only through Oracle Ksplice, their live patching service that requires a Premier Support subscription.  
Since PMM relies solely on public repositories, Ksplice-only updates cannot be included.

The risk is currently assessed as low because PMM is usually deployed in controlled environments. These issues will be remediated once public Oracle Linux updates are available.
