Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is a free and open-source platform for managing and monitoring MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL performance.

## Release Highlights

- **Grafana Upgrade** Embedded Grafana version was upgraded from 7.5.7 to 7.5.11 to improve some Grafana instrumentation metrics. Also, the upgrade is delivering a security fix that impacted Grafana. Please upgrade to the latest version of PMM ASAP. Read more about CVE issue [here](https://grafana.com/blog/2021/10/05/grafana-7.5.11-and-8.1.6-released-with-critical-security-fix/)


- **Backup Management (Technical preview):**
    - An ability to view logs of the backup process for better visibility over the backup process
    - An ability to schedule Point-In-Time-Recoverable backup from MongoDB clusters with the correct configuration. Note: there is no UI  to restore PITR for MongoDB at the moment. It will come with future releases, but it is possible to restore a PITR backup with [Percona Backup for MongoDB](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-backup-mongodb/point-in-time-recovery.html) manually

- **DBaaS (Technical preview):**  From this release on, PMM users who are using the DBaaS feature will be able to update versions of their DBaaS controlled Databases by the push of a button according to each DB's compatibility matrix.
Please note that we recently found a bug [PMM-8723](#bugs-fixed) that was causing significant problems with DBaaS usage. This bug was fixed in this release, and no additional actions will be required.
