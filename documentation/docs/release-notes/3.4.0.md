### Configure PMM Clients centrally

PMM Server now supports centralized configuration of all connected PMM Clients through environment variables. 

Instead of configuring each client individually, you can set VMAGENT_* variables once on PMM Server to automatically apply vmagent settings across your entire monitoring infrastructure. 

This is particularly useful for Kubernetes environments where the default 1GB disk usage per client can overwhelm shared storage. 

For example, setting VMAGENT_remoteWrite_maxDiskUsagePerURL=52428800 reduces disk usage to 50MB per client and applies to all connected clients without restarts.

For complete configuration options and examples, [see Client configuration variables](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/docker/env_var.md#configure-pmm-clients-with-environment-variables).
