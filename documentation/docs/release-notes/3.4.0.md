Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB. PMM empowers you to: 

- monitor the health and performance of your database systems
- identify patterns and trends in database behavior
- diagnose and resolve issues faster with actionable insights
- manage databases across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments

## Release summary

## Release highlights

### OpenShift support for PMM Server

Building on the OpenShift compatibility available for PMM Client, PMM 3.4.0 extends this support to PMM Server. All PMM Docker images now comply with Red Hat certification requirements, including non-root user execution and SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) support, ensuring seamless deployment of both PMM Client and Server in OpenShift environments. 

While OpenShift 4.15 is fully tested and supported, other versions are likely working but not guaranteed. To deploy  PMM Server on OpenShift using the standard Percona Helm charts with platform-specific parameters, see the [Install PMM Server on your Kubernetes cluster/Openshift clusters](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/helm/index.md).

### Centralized `vmagent` settings for all clients

You can now centrally configure `vmagent` settings for all connected PMM Clients using environment variables.

Instead of configuring each client individually, set `VMAGENT_*` variables on the PMM Server to automatically apply `vmagent` settings across your entire monitoring infrastructure. 

This is particularly useful for Kubernetes environments where the default 1GB disk usage per client can overwhelm shared storage. For example, setting `VMAGENT_remoteWrite_maxDiskUsagePerURL=52428800` reduces disk usage to 50MB per client and applies to all connected clients without restarts.

For configuration options and examples, see [Configure environment variables for PMM Server](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/docker/env_var.md#configure-vmagent-on-pmm-client).


## Improvements

- [PMM-13980](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13980) - Improved [Back up PMM Server Docker container](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/docker/backup_container.md) documentation for all PMM Server deployment types, including `pmm-data volume` procedures essential for migrating from PMM 2 to PMM 3.
- [PMM-14194](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14194) - Custom filter groups in Query Analytics (QAN) now correctly distinguish between intentional comments and quoted strings containing comment-like characters. Previously, queries with values like `street = '123 Main St # app=something'` would incorrectly generate unwanted custom filters. Now, only genuine SQL comments such as `-- app='web', team='backend'` create filter options in the **PMM Query Analytics** dashboard sidebar. This means that you get cleaner query categorization when [comment parsing](/documentation/docs/use/qan/panels/filters.md#custom-filter-groups) is enabled.

## Components upgrade
- [PMM-14015](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-14015) - PMM now ships with Grafana 11.6.3, bringing enhanced security and improved performance.
