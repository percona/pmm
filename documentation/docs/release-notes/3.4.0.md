## Release summary
## Release highlights

### Centralized `vmagent` settings for all clients

You can now centrally configure `vmagent` settings for all connected PMM Clients using environment variables.

Instead of configuring each client individually, set `VMAGENT_*` variables on the PMM Server to automatically apply `vmagent` settings across your entire monitoring infrastructure. 

This is particularly useful for Kubernetes environments where the default 1GB disk usage per client can overwhelm shared storage. For example, setting `VMAGENT_remoteWrite_maxDiskUsagePerURL=52428800` reduces disk usage to 50MB per client and applies to all connected clients without restarts.

For configuration options and examples, see [Configure environment variables for PMM Server](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/docker/env_var.md#pmm-client-configuration-variables).
