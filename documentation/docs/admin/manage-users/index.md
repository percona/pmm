# About user management in PMM

A user refers to any individual who can log in to PMM. Each user is assigned a specific role that is associated with permissions. Permissions determine the tasks a user can perform in the system. For instance, the Admin role confers permissions that allow an authorized administrator to create and delete user profiles. 

The following topics are covered as part of access control:

- [Add users](add_users.md)
- [Edit users](edit_users.md)
- [Delete users](delete_users.md)
