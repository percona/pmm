# Enable access control

Access control in PMM lets you restrict user access to specific metrics and Query Analytics data based on their roles. 
Choose your preferred method to enable this feature:

=== "Via Docker"

    When deploying PMM Server with Docker, enable access control by passing an environment variable:
    
    ```sh
    docker run -d \
      --name pmm-server \
      -p 443:443 \
      -e PMM_ENABLE_ACCESS_CONTROL=1 \
      percona/pmm-server:latest
    ```

=== "Via Docker Compose"

    For Docker Compose deployments, add the environment variable to your `docker-compose.yml` file:
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      pmm-server:
        image: percona/pmm-server:latest
        ports:
          - "443:443"
        environment:
          - PMM_ENABLE_ACCESS_CONTROL=1
        volumes:
          - pmm-data:/srv
    ```

=== "Via user interface"

    To enable access control from the PMM web interface:
    {.power-number}
    
    1. Log in to PMM with an administrator account.
    2. From the main menu, go to **PMM Configuration > Settings > Advanced Settings > Access Control**.
    3. Toggle the <i class="uil uil-toggle-off"></i> toggle.
    4. Click **Apply changes** to save your settings.

## After enabling access control

Once access control is enabled:

- All existing users will have full access until you assign specific roles.
- [Create access roles](../access-control/create_roles.md) for different user types.
- [Assign the new roles](../index.md) to your PMM users.
- Test that restrictions work as expected.
