# Labels for access control
Label-based access control in PMM allows you to precisely manage which monitoring data users can access based on their roles and responsibilities. 

This feature is essential for organizations with multiple teams, compliance requirements, or where different users need different levels of visibility.

## How LBAC works
Access control in PMM uses Prometheus label selectors to filter metrics and Query Analytics data.

Here's how it works: 
{.power-number}

1. Create roles with specific label selectors. For example, you might allow the QA team to access only metrics related to test environments by assigning them a role with the `environment=test` label or limit visibility to metrics related only to MySQL services with the `service_type=mysql` label.
2. Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities. Each role can include multiple labels, and only data series matching all associated labels will be visible to users with that role. This ensures precise, fine-grained access control to your data.
3. Users see only the metrics and data that match their role's label selectors

## Standard vs custom labels

PMM supports two types of labels for access control. When a user adds a service to monitoring, PMM automatically assigns standard labels based on the service type, such as `service_type`, `agent_type`, and `node_name`. Additional labels like `service_id` and `node_id` are also auto-generated by PMM.

You can override some standard labels when creating objects such as Nodes, Services, or Agents. You can also define and assign custom labels. Unlike standard labels, custom labels are user-defined and can only be added or updated manually.

Both standard and custom labels are propagated to the relevant metrics collected by the PMM Client. These labels are preserved during metric collection and can be used in PromQL queries.

**Examples**

| **Label Type**| **Object**| **Label name** | **Example** |                                                                                                
|---------------|-----------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Standard**  | Node      | node_id         | 5bdfb1b4-c6c4-4086-83a2-e8daa0b84d4b |                                          
| **Standard**  | Service   | service_type    | mysql, mongodb, postgresql etc.      |
| **Custom**    | Node, Service, Agent | Any string matching the regular expression: <br /> [a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*. <br /> Also, it cannot start with two underscores.| owner="joe"<br/> _rack="12345"|

## Adding labels when creating services

You can add standard or custom labels while adding a service to monitoring in PMM.

=== "Using the PMM UI"
    To set the labels via the user interface:
    {.power-number}

    1. From the **Main** menu, go to **PMM Configuration > PMM Services > Add Service**.

    2. Select the service you want to monitor.

    3. Complete the required connection details. 

    4. Enter standard labels via the input section `Labels`.

    5. Enter custom labels via section `Custom labels`.

=== "Using pmm-admin"

    You can also add standard and custom labels using [pmm-admin](../../../use/commands/pmm-admin.md).

## Modifying existing labels
PMM allows modifying certain standard labels after a service is created:

- `environment`
- `cluster`
-  `replication_set`
- `external_group`

For other standard labels that cannot be modified directly, you must remove the service and re-add it with the desired labels.

This can be done either via PMM UI or via an [API endpoint](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/changeservice){:target="_blank"}.

Modifying the custom labels can be done as well via PMM UI of via the same [API endpoint](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/changeservice){:target="_blank"}.
