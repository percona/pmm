# About Query Analytics (QAN)

The Query Analytics dashboard shows how queries are executed and where they spend their time. It helps you analyze database queries over time, optimize database performance, and find and remedy the source of problems.

Query Analytics supports MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL with the following minimum requirements:

=== "MySQL requirements"
    - MySQL 5.1 or later (if using the slow query log)
    - MySQL 5.6.9 or later (if using Performance Schema)
    - Percona Server 5.6+ (all Performance Schema and slow log features)
    - MariaDB 5.2+ (for user statistics), 10.0+ (for Performance Schema)

    Some limitations and tuning options apply only when using MySQLâ€™s Performance Schema.  
    See [Query Analytics with MySQL](../qan/mysql.md#limitations-with-performance-schema).

=== "PostgreSQL requirements"
    - PostgreSQL 11 or later
    - `pg_stat_monitor` extension (recommended) or `pg_stat_statements` extension
    - Appropriate `shared_preload_libraries` configuration
    - Superuser privileges for PMM monitoring account

=== "MongoDB requirements"
    - MongoDB 6.0 or later (4.4+ may work with limited features)

    ### Requirements for Profiler
    - Profiling enabled for Query Analytics
    - Appropriate user roles: `clusterMonitor`, `read` (local), and custom monitoring roles. For MongoDB 8.0+: Additional `directShardOperations` role required for sharded clusters

    ### Requirements for Mongolog

    - MongoDB configured to log slow operations to a file
    - MongoDB server has write permissions to the log directory and file
    - PMM agent has read permissions to the MongoDB log file
    - Appropriate user roles: `clusterMonitor`, or custom monitoring roles (`getCmdLineOpts` privilege on `{ cluster: true }`)

## Dashboard components
Query Analytics displays metrics in both visual and numeric form. Performance-related characteristics appear as plotted graphics with summaries.

## Dashboard layout
The dashboard contains three panels:

- the [Filters panel](panels/filters.md)
- the [Overview panel](panels/overview.md)
- the [Details panel](panels/details.md)

### Data retrieval delays

Query Analytics data retrieval is not instantaneous because metrics are collected once per minute. When collection delays occur, no data is reported and gaps will appear in the sparkline.

## Label-based access control

Query Analytics integrates with PMM's [label-based access control (LBAC)](../../admin/roles/access-control/intro.md) to enforce data security and user permissions.

When LBAC is enabled:

- users see only queries from databases and services permitted by their assigned roles
- filter dropdown options are dynamically restricted based on user permissions
- data visibility is controlled through Prometheus-style label selectors
