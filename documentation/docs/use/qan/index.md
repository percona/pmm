# About query analytics (QAN)

The Query Analytics dashboard shows how queries are executed and where they spend their time. It helps you analyze database queries over time, optimize database performance, and find and remedy the source of problems.

## Supported databases

Query Analytics supports MySQL, MongoDB and PostgreSQL with the following minimum requirements:

### MySQL requirements

- MySQL 5.1 or later (if using the slow query log).
- MySQL 5.6.9 or later (if using Performance Schema).
- Percona Server 5.6+ (all Performance Schema and slow log features)


### Dashboard components
Query Analytics displays metrics in both visual and numeric form. Performance-related characteristics appear as plotted graphics with summaries.

The dashboard contains three panels:

- the [Filters Panel](panels/filters.md);
- the [Overview Panel](panels/overview.md);
- the [Details Panel](panels/details.md).

    Query Analytics data retrieval is not instantaneous and can be delayed due to network conditions. In such situations *no data* is reported and a gap appears in the sparkline.

## Limitation: Missing query examples in MySQL Performance Schema

When using MySQL's Performance Schema as the query source, you may encounter the message *“Sorry, no examples found”* in the QAN dashboard. This typically occurs due to the way MySQL handles query sampling and can be influenced by the number of threads, volume of unique queries, and Performance Schema settings.

Despite the absence of query examples, all other query metrics are still collected and displayed as expected.

### Why this happens

MySQL Performance Schema manages query data across two different tables, which can lead to missing query examples:

- `events_statements_summary_by_digest`: stores aggregated metrics for each normalized query (digest). Each unique query appears only once, regardless of how many times it runs.

- `events_statements_history` (`events_statements_history_long` in MariaDB): stores individual query executions in a rolling buffer. Multiple entries may exist for the same query, but older ones are overwritten as new queries are executed.

A query may appear in the digest summary but not in the history table when:

- it was executed frequently enough to appear in the digest summary.
- all its individual executions were overwritten the history buffer due thigh query volume overwhelming the buffer and ongoing activity.

When this happens, QAN can still display the query’s metrics, but cannot show an example query  because it's no longer available in `events_statements_history` table when PMM tries to capture it.

### Workaround

If you're missing query examples, consider [using the slow query log (`slowlog`)](../../../docs/install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mysql/mysql.md#configure-data-source) as the query source instead. 
The `slowlog` retains actual query texts over time and can help capture examples even when Performance Schema history buffers are exhausted.
