# Query Analytics for MongoDB

MongoDB is conceptually different from relational database management systems, such as MySQL and MariaDB.

Relational database management systems store data in tables that represent single entities. Complex objects are represented by linking tables.

In contrast, MongoDB uses the concept of a document where all essential information for a complex object is stored in one place.

Query Analytics can monitor MongoDB queries. Although MongoDB is not a relational database management system, you analyze its databases and collections in the same interface using the same tools.
