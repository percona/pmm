Each row of the table represents the metrics for a chosen object type, one of:

- Query;
- Service Name;
- Database;
- Schema;
- User Name;
- Client Host.

At the top of the second column is the **dimension** menu. Use this to choose the object type.

## Columns

- The first column is the object’s identifier. For **Query**, it is the query’s [Fingerprint](../../../reference/glossary.md#fingerprint).
- The second column is the **Main metric**, containing a reduced graphical representation of the metric over time, called a **sparkline**, and a horizontal meter, filled to reflect a percentage of the total value.
- Additional values are revealed as mouse-over tool-tips.

## Tool-tips

- For the **Query** dimension, hovering over the information icon <i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> reveals the query ID and its example.
- Hovering on a column header reveals an informative tool-tip for that column.
- Hovering on the main metric sparkline highlights the data point and a tooltip shows the data value under the cursor.
