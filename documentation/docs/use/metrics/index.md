# About PMM metrics

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) collects a range of metrics across database systems to provide comprehensive monitoring and analysis capabilities. 

PMM supports monitoring for databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,  MongoDB, among many others. It gathers metrics related to database performance, resource utilization, health, and other important aspects. 

These metrics power the [PMM dashboards](../../use/dashboards-panels/index.md) to help you monitor, troubleshoot, and optimize your database environments.
