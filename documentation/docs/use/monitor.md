# About monitoring in PMM

PMM continuously collects, stores, visualizes, and analyzes various metrics from database engines, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, amongst many others. With PMM, you can monitor your database environment and gain insights into its behavior. 

Some of the key functionalities of monitoring in PMM are:

- **Performance monitoring**: PMM collects metrics such as query execution times, throughput, latency, and resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk I/O). This helps identify performance bottlenecks and optimize query execution for better efficiency.
- **Resource utilization:** PMM monitors CPU usage, memory, disk I/O, and network traffic to optimize resource allocation.
- **Database health checks**:  PMM monitors various metrics, such as replication status, uptime, connections, server status, and error rates, to ensure system availability and identify potential issues.
