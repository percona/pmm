# Migrate PMM 2 to PMM 3

PMM 3 introduces significant architectural changes that require gradual transition from PMM 2.

You can migrate to PMM 3 either automatically using the upgrade script (recommended), or manually by following step-by-step instructions.

To graduallly migrate to PMM 3:

## Step 1: Upgrade PMM 2 Server to the latest version

Before upgrading to PMM 3, ensure your PMM 2 Server is running the latest version:
{.power-number}

1. From the **Home** page, scroll to the **PMM Upgrade** panel and click the Refresh button to manually check for updates.
2. If an update is available, click the **Update** button to install the latest PMM 2 version.
3. Verify the update was successful by checking the version number after the update completes.

## Step 2: Migrate PMM 2 Server to PMM 3

=== "Automated Docker upgrade (Recommended)"
    Use this upgrade script for a simplified migration process:
    { .power-number}

    1. Download and run the [automated upgrade script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/pmm/0ad7c05ae253948c779e48ff7976cb5c982af688/get-pmm.sh) to start the upgrade. The `-b` flag creates a backup of your PMM2 instance to ensure that your data is backed up before the upgrade.

        ```sh
        ./get-pmm.sh -n <container-name> -b
        ```
    2. Note the backup volume name displayed during the upgrade (e.g., `pmm-data-2025-01-16-165135`) so that you can restore this backup if needed.

    3. Check additional script options:
        ```sh
        ./get-pmm.sh -h
        ```
    !!! note alert alert-primary "Restore PMM 2 backup"
        If you need to revert to the PMM 2 instance, restore the backup created above:
        { .power-number}

        1. Stop the PMM 3 container:
            ```sh
            docker stop pmm-server
            ```
        2. Start a PMM 2 container using the backup volume, replacing `<backup-volume-name>` (e.g., `pmm-data-2025-01-16-165135`) with your actual backup volume name:

            ```sh
            docker run -d -p 443:443 --volume <backup-volume-name>:/srv --name pmm-server --restart always percona/pmm-server:2.44.0
            ```
        3. Verify that your PMM 2 instance is running correctly and all your data is accessible.

=== "Manual upgrade (Docker/Kubernetes/Podman)"
    === "Docker with volume"
        Follow these manual steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server to PMM 3:
        { .power-number}

        1. Stop all PMM Server services:

            ```sh
            docker exec -t <pmm-server> supervisorctl stop all
            ```

        2. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:

            ```sh
            docker exec -t <pmm-server> chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
            ```

        3. List and note down your Docker volume:
       
            ```sh
            {% raw %}
            docker inspect -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ if eq .Type "volume" }}{{ .Name }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' <pmm-server>
            {% endraw %}
            ```

        4. Stop and remove existing container:

            ```sh
            docker stop pmm-server && docker rm pmm-server
            ```

        5. Pull PMM 3 Server image:

            ```sh
            docker pull percona/pmm-server:3
            ```

        6. Run new new version of PMM Server with the existing volume:
       
            ```sh
            docker run -d -v pmm-server-data:/srv -p 443:8443 --name pmm-server --restart always percona/pmm-server:3
            ```

    === "Docker with data container"
        Follow these manual steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server to PMM 3:
        { .power-number}

        1. Stop all PMM Server services:

            ```sh
            docker exec -t <pmm-server> supervisorctl stop all
            ```

        2. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:

            ```sh
            docker exec -t <pmm-server> chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
            ```

        3. Identify the data container using either:
       
            ```sh
            docker ps -a --filter "status=created"
            ```
           
            OR

            ```sh
            {% raw %}
            docker inspect -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ if eq .Type "volume" }}{{ .Name }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' <pmm-server>
            {% endraw %}
            ```
            
        4. Stop and remove the existing container:

            ```sh
            docker stop pmm-server && docker rm pmm-server
            ```

        5. Pull PMM 3 Server image:
       
            ```sh
            docker pull percona/pmm-server:3
            ``` 

        6. Run the new version of PMM Server with the existing data container:

            ```sh
            docker run -d --volumes-from pmm-server-data -p 443:8443 --name pmm-server --restart always percona/pmm-server:3
            ```

    === "Kubernetes with Helm chart"
        Follow these steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server deployed with Helm to PMM 3:
        {.power-number}

        1. Update the Percona Helm repository:
            ```sh
            helm repo update percona
            ```

        2. Export current values to a file:
            ```sh
            helm show values percona/pmm > values.yaml
            ```

        3. Update the `values.yaml` file to match your PMM 2 configuration

        4. Stop all PMM Server services:
            ```sh
            kubectl exec pmm-0 -- supervisorctl stop all
            ```

        5. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:
            ```sh
            kubectl exec pmm-0 -- chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
            ```

        6. Upgrade PMM using Helm:
            ```sh
            helm upgrade pmm -f values.yaml --set secret.create=false --set secret.name=pmm-secret percona/pmm
            ```

        7. If Kubernetes is not upgraded automatically, delete the pod to force recreation:
            ```sh
            kubectl delete pod pmm-0
            ```

    === "Local instance with Podman"
        Follow these steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server deployed with Podman to PMM 3:
        {.power-number}

        1. Pull the PMM 3 Server image:
            ```sh
            podman pull percona/pmm-server:3
            ```

        2. Stop all PMM Server services:
            ```sh
            podman exec pmm-server supervisorctl stop all
            ```

        3. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:
            ```sh
            podman exec pmm-server chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
            ```

        4. Remove the existing systemd service file:
            ```sh
            rm ~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.service
            ```

        5. Follow the installation steps from the [PMM 3 Podman installation guide](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/baremetal/podman/index.md) to complete the upgrade.

## Step 3: Migrate PMM 2 Clients to PMM 3

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    PMM 3 Server provides limited support for PMM 2 Clients (metrics and Query Analytics only). This support will be removed in PMM 3.3.

Depending on your initial installation method, update PMM Clients using your operating system's package manager or using a tarball.
For detailed instructions, see the [Upgrade PMM Client topic](../pmm-upgrade/upgrade_client.md).

### Post-migration steps

After you finish migrating:
{.power-number}

1. Verify that all PMM Clients are up to date by checking **PMM Configuration > Updates**.
2. Confirm all previously monitored services are reporting correctly to the new PMM 3 Server by reviewing **Configuration > PMM Inventory > Services**.
3. Check the dashboards to make sure you're receiving the metrics and QAN data.
