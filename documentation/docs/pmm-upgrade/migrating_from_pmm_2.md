# Migrate PMM 2 to PMM 3

PMM 3 introduces significant architectural changes that require gradual transition from PMM 2:

## Step 1: Upgrade PMM 2 Server to the latest version

Before upgrading to PMM 3, ensure your PMM 2 Server is running the latest version:
{.power-number}

1. From the **Home** page, scroll to the **PMM Upgrade** panel and click the Refresh button to manually check for updates.
2. If an update is available, click the **Update** button to install the latest PMM 2 version.
3. Verify the update was successful by checking the version number after the update completes.

## Step 2: Migrate PMM 2 Server to PMM 3

=== "PMM 2 with Docker volume"

    Follow these manual steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server to PMM 3:
    { .power-number}

    1. Stop all PMM Server services:

        ```sh
        docker exec -t <pmm-server> supervisorctl stop all
        ```

    2. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:

        ```sh
         docker exec -t <pmm-server> chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
        ```

    3. List and note down your Docker volume:
   
        ```sh
        {% raw %}
        docker inspect -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ if eq .Type "volume" }}{{ .Name }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' <pmm-server>
        {% endraw %}
        ```

    4. Stop and remove existing container:

        ```sh
        docker stop pmm-server && docker rm pmm-server
        ```

    5. Pull PMM 3 Server image:

        ```sh
        docker pull perconalab/pmm-server:3.0.0-beta
        ```

    6. Run new container with existing volume:
   
        ```sh
        docker run -d -v pmm-server-data:/srv -p 443:8443 --name pmm-server --restart always perconalab/pmm-server:3.0.0-beta
        ```

=== "PMM 2 with data container"

    Follow these manual steps to upgrade your PMM 2 Server to PMM 3:
    { .power-number}

    1. Stop all PMM Server services:

        ```sh
        docker exec -t <pmm-server> supervisorctl stop all
        ```

    2. Transfer `/srv` directory ownership:

        ```sh
        docker exec -t <pmm-server> chown -R pmm:pmm /srv
        ```

    3. Identify data container using either:
   
        ```sh
        docker ps -a --filter "status=created"
        ```
       
        OR

        ```sh
        {% raw %}
        docker inspect -f '{{ range .Mounts }}{{ if eq .Type "volume" }}{{ .Name }}{{ "\n" }}{{ end }}{{ end }}' <pmm-server>
        {% endraw %}
        ```
        
    4. Stop and remove existing container:

        ```sh
        docker stop pmm-server && docker rm pmm-server
        ```

    5. Pull PMM 3 Server image:
   
        ```sh
        docker pull perconalab/pmm-server:3.0.0-beta
        ``` 

    6. Run new container with existing data container:

        ```sh
        docker run -d --volumes-from pmm-server-data -p 443:8443 --name pmm-server --restart always perconalab/pmm-server:3.0.0-beta
        ``` 

## Step 3: Migrate PMM 2 Clients to PMM 3

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Important"
    PMM 3 Server provides limited support for PMM 2 Clients (metrics and Query Analytics only). This support will be removed in PMM 3.3.

Depending on your initial installation method, update PMM Clients using your operating system's package manager or by updating from a tarball.
For detailed instructions, see the [Upgrade PMM Client topic](../pmm-upgrade/upgrade_client.md).

## Step 4: Migrate your API keys to service accounts

PMM 3 replaces API keys with service accounts to enhance security and simplify access management. You can trigger this API key conversion from the UI or from the CLI.
	
### From the UI
PMM automatically migrates existing API keys to service accounts when you first log in as an Admin user. The migration results are displayed in a popup dialog box. 

If no popup appears, it likely means there are no API keys to migrateâ€”this is typical for PMM Servers without connected services.
	
### From CLI
You can also initiate the conversion using the following command. 
Be sure to replace `admin:admin` with your credentials and update the server address (`localhost` or `127.0.0.1`) and port number (`3000`) if they differ from the defaults:

	
```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/serviceaccounts/migrate \
-u admin:admin \
-H "Content-Type: application/json
```
	
The response will display the migration details:

!!! example "Expected output"

	```
	{"total":3,"migrated":3,"failed":0,"failedApikeyIDs":[],"failedDetails":[]}
	```    
	
### Verify the conversion
	
To verify the that API keys were successfully migrated, go to **Administration > Users and Access > Service Accounts** where you can check the list of service accounts available and confirm that the **API Keys** menu is no longer displayed.

If any API keys fail to migrate, you can either: 

- delete the problematic API keys and create new service accounts
- keep using the existing API keys until you're ready to replace them

### Post-migration steps

After you finish migrating PMM:
{.power-number}

1. Verify that all PMM Clients are up to date by checking **PMM Configuration > Updates**.
2. Confirm all previously monitored services are reporting correctly to the new PMM 3 Server by reviewing **Configuration > PMM Inventory > Services**.
3. Check the dashboards to make sure you're receiving the metrics information and QAN data.
