# Upgrade PMM Server on AWS

Keep your PMM Server up to date with the latest features, security patches, and performance improvements.

## Prerequisites

Before upgrading your PMM Server, ensure you have:

- a current backup of your PMM data volume
- scheduled maintenance window for potential downtime

## Check current version

Verify your current PMM Server version:

```bash
# Via web interface: PMM Configuration > Updates
# Or via command line:
docker exec pmm-server pmm-admin --version
```

## Upgrade options

=== "In-place upgrade (Recommended)"

    **Best for:** Minor version updates and patches
    {.power-number}
    
    1. Create a backup snapshot of your PMM data volume:

        ```bash
        aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-xxxxxxxxx --description "Pre-upgrade backup $(date)"
        ```

    2. Update the PMM Server container:

       ```bash
       # SSH to your PMM instance
       ssh -i /path/to/your-key.pem admin@<pmm-server-ip>

       # Pull the latest PMM Server image
       sudo docker pull percona/pmm-server:latest

       # Stop the current PMM Server
       sudo docker stop pmm-server

       # Remove the old container (data is preserved in volumes)
       sudo docker rm pmm-server

       # Start the new container with the same configuration
       sudo docker run -d \
         -p 80:80 \
         -p 443:443 \
         --volumes-from pmm-data \
         --name pmm-server \
         --restart always \
         percona/pmm-server:latest
       ```
    3. Verify the upgrade:

    
       ```bash
       # Check container status
       sudo docker ps
       
       # Verify PMM is accessible
       curl -k https://localhost/ping
       
       # Check version via web interface
       ```

=== "Blue-green deployment"

    **Best for:** Major version upgrades or when minimizing downtime is critical.
    {.power-number}

    1. Launch a new PMM instance with the latest version following the [deployment guide](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/aws/deploy_aws.md).

    2. Create a volume from your PMM data snapshot and attach it to the new instance to restore data from backup.

    3. Update PMM clients to point to the new server:

        ```bash
        # On each monitored host
        pmm-admin config --server-url=https://new-pmm-server-ip:443
        ```
    4. Decommission the old instance once verified.

=== "Specific version upgrade"

    **Best for:** Upgrading to a specific PMM version instead of latest

    ```bash
    # Example: Upgrade to PMM 3.0.0
    sudo docker pull percona/pmm-server:3.0.0

    # Follow the same container replacement steps but use the specific tag
    sudo docker run -d \
      -p 80:80 \
      -p 443:443 \
      --volumes-from pmm-data \
      --name pmm-server \
      --restart always \
      percona/pmm-server:3.0.0
    ```

## Post-upgrade tasks

After upgrading PMM Server:
{.power-number}

1. Verify all services are running:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec pmm-server supervisorctl status
   ```

2. Check PMM client connectivity:
   ```bash
   # On monitored hosts
   pmm-admin status
   pmm-admin list
   ```

3. Update PMM clients if required for compatibility:
   ```bash
   # Download and install latest PMM Client
   wget https://www.percona.com/downloads/pmm2/pmm-client/pmm2-client-latest.tar.gz
   ```

4. Review dashboards and alerting rules for any changes or new features.

5. Test monitoring functionality to ensure data collection continues normally.

## Rollback procedure

If issues occur after upgrade, rollback the container:
{.power-number}

1. Stop the new PMM container:
```bash
sudo docker stop pmm-server
sudo docker rm pmm-server
```
2. Start previous version:
```bash
sudo docker run -d \
-p 80:80 \
-p 443:443 \
--volumes-from pmm-data \
--name p
```

## Post-upgrade tasks

After upgrading PMM Server:
{.power-number}

1. Verify all services are running:
   ```bash
   sudo docker exec pmm-server supervisorctl status
   ```

2. Check PMM client connectivity:
   ```bash
   # On monitored hosts
   pmm-admin status
   pmm-admin list
   ```

3. Update PMM clients if required for compatibility:
   ```bash
   # Download and install latest PMM Client
   wget https://www.percona.com/downloads
   ```

4. Review dashboards and alerting rules for any changes or new features.

5. Test monitoring functionality to ensure data collection continues normally.

## Rollback procedure

If issues occur after upgrade:
{.power-number}

1. Stop the new PMM container:
   ```bash
   sudo docker stop pmm-server
   sudo docker rm pmm-server
   ```

2. Restore from backup by creating a volume from your pre-upgrade snapshot, attaching it to the instance, and starting the previous PMM version.

3. Revert PMM Clients if they were updated:

   ```bash
   # Reinstall previous client version
   pmm-admin config --server-url=https://original-pmm-server:443
   ```

## Troubleshooting upgrades

### Container won't start after upgrade

```bash
# Check logs
sudo docker logs pmm-server

# Verify volume mounts
sudo docker inspect pmm-server
```

### Database migration issues

```bash
# Access PMM container
sudo docker exec -it pmm-server bash

# Check database status
pmm-admin status
```
## Automated upgrade scheduling

Consider implementing automated upgrade workflows:

- set up CloudWatch alarms to monitor PMM health
- use AWS Systems Manager for automated patching schedules
- implement backup automation before upgrades
- create upgrade runbooks for your team

## Next steps

After successful upgrade:

- [Configure new features](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/deployment-options/aws/configure_aws.md) introduced in the latest version
- [Update monitoring alerts](../alert/index.md) to use new capabilities
