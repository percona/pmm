Now with PMM 2.14.0, Percona is shifting the default to push for all newly-added instances. This blog post describes the two methods and why push benefits users. Also, here is a post by Peter Zaitzev of FAQs relating to the move to VictoriaMetrics and the push model.

When metrics cannot be collected or are no longer needed, disabling the collector(s) prevents PMM from flooding logs and saves infrastructure resources.</p> <p>Our vision for PMM collectors is to provide \u201cstop from collecting\u201d functionality to prevent possible harm to the user environment. This \u201cdisable\u201d feature is an initial step towards the ideal functionality. The full and flexible management for \u201cWhat metrics to collect and in what resolution\u201d is slated for future releases.</p> <p>External services monitoring</p> <p>Since PMM 1.4.0, users had the ability to monitor external services Percona didn\u2019t currently support (e.g., Redis). This blog article from 2018 nicely described external services monitoring at that time. (At that time Percona was not natively supporting a PostgreSQL monitoring service and so this was listed as an external service. Today, PostgreSQL is natively supported by PMM.)</p> <p>Until now, PMM 2.x didn\u2019t support external services monitoring. With this release, any non-natively supported by PMM service will now become supported with external services monitoring. You can see the list of possible exporters to be used in https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/. Natively-supported services will continue to deliver an expanded set of metrics and insights.</p> <p>Provide summary information for  systems (<code>pt-*-summary actions</code>)</p> <p>With the addition of <code>pt-*-summary</code> in PMM 2, users can now view summary information about services and nodes on PMM\u2019s dashboard. This summary information is in the industry common format of <code>pt-*-summary</code> tools output to simplify portability of this data. This format will also be preserved in the snapshot of the dashboard shared with Percona Support to simplify investigations of issues.</p> <p>Note: <code>pt-*-summary</code> includes formats for:</p> <ul> <li><code>pt-mysql-summary</code></li> <li><code>pt-mongodb-summary</code></li> <li><code>pt-pg-summary</code></li> <li><code>pt-summary</code></li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>HAProxy support by PMM</p> <p>Users are able to add HAProxy Services for monitoring in PMM2. The support level of them in PMM will be the same we have for ProxySQL, so they will be presented in Inventory and on Dashboard. This will allow users who use HAProxy in their HA configuration to also have this component monitored by PMM. In future releases PMM will start use HAProxy by default for the DBaaS feature and will also use this functionality to monitor HAProxy.</p> </li> <li> <p>DBaaS Preview improvements (Technical  Preview)</p> <p>From now you will be able to see the progress of internal steps the system makes when executing some operations with DBaaS. The Progress Bar will not be time-related and will present only steps. The Progress Bar component will also reflect the K8s/Operator-related errors to the user, so in the case of errors, you will have the error text on the UI, and no need to use K8s tools to see the error. With the same UI, you will be able to see the latest logs from K8s so they will have even more information about why the error happened.</p> <p>Known Limitations: The progress bar will not provide valuable information for the Delete operation (will be in a later version when we\u2019ll change the API with Operators Team), Operation of DB Cluster Modification will have \u201cstrange\u201d behavior and will start changes from non-zero values of steps.

A network outage between the PMM server and the client prevented metrics from being collected. As a result, the historical data was lost, which can be useful when analyzing trends, diagnosing problems, or investigating issues from a previous period.</p> <p>In order to address the problem mentioned above, for the PMM server and PMM client running version 2.33.0, in case of a brief outage or network issue, metrics are stored on the monitored instance until the PMM server is up and running. At this point, the metrics will be pushed to the server. It only applies to PMM Clients that run in push mode, which is the default mode. The same holds when a brief network outage occurs on the client side.</p> <p>Caution</p> <p>The client node can currently store only 1 GB of offline data. So, for example, if your instance is down for three days, all the data will not be retrieved.</p> <p>With the implementation of the above feature, we have taken the first step toward PMM HA. Furthermore, we are happy to provide a roadmap for PMM HA implementation, a much-anticipated solution by our users. In the event of a failover, your PMM setup will experience near-zero downtime, and monitoring will continue with the offline metric collection.</p> <p>To ensure a smooth rollout, PMM HA will be introduced in phases, in line with your requirements and feedback.</p> <p>Important</p> <p>PMM HA will be rolled out in three stages. Stage one of PMM HA is the implementation to prevent data collection interruption with VictoriaMetrics integration for short outages included as part of PMM 2.33.0.
