## Authentication

PMM Server's user authentication is built on top of and is compatible with [Grafana authentication](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/auth/grafana/).

In this section we will talk about two main authentication mechanisms:

- Basic HTTP authentication
- Bearer Authentication (Authentication with an API key)

### Basic HTTP Authentication

Basic authentication is a very simple way to authenticate a user. An API request must contain a header field in the form of `Authorization: Basic <credentials>`, where `<credentials>` is the Base64 encoding of ID (most often username or login) and password joined by a single colon `:`.

Let's assume the username is `admin` and the password is also `admin`. Then the API call to get the PMM Server version info would be as follows:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46YWRtaW4=' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://127.0.0.1/v1/version
```

If you use `curl` to make API calls, a simple equivalent to the command above is:

```bash
curl -X GET -u admin:admin -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://127.0.0.1/v1/version
```

### Bearer Authentication

Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The bearer token is a cryptic API key, which can be generated by the server admin from the Settings UI or via a respective API call (<a href="https://pmm-doc.onrender.com/details/api.html#generate-api-keys">read more about how to generate an API key</a>). The client must send the API key in the `Authorization` header when making requests to protected resources:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Authorization: Bearer eyJrIjoiUXRkeDNMS1g1bFVyY0tUj1o0SmhBc3g4QUdTRVAwekoiLCJuIjoicG1tLXRlc3QiLCJpZCI6MX0=' \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://127.0.0.1/v1/version
```

You can use the API key in basic authentication as well:

```bash
curl -X GET -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
https://api_key:eyJrIjoiUXRkeDNMS1g1bFVyY0tUj1o0SmhBc3g4QUdTRVAwekoiLCJuIjoicG1tLXRlc3QiLCJpZCI6MX0=@127.0.0.1/v1/version

```
