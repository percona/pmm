To get most PMM, you need to keep your PMM server up to date.

Here are the main methods you need to achieve it:

1. [Check for upgrade](ref:checkupdates-1) to see is there is an upgrade available
2. [Start upgrade](ref:startupdate-1) to start the process if a new version is available
3. [Check progress](ref:checkupdates-1) to keep track of the process
