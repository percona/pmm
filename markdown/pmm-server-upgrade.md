To get the most PMM, you need to keep your PMM server up to date.

Here are the APIs you'll use to achieve it:

1. [Check for upgrade](ref:checkupdates) to see is there is an upgrade available
2. [Start upgrade](ref:startupdate) to start the process if a new version is available
3. [Check progress](ref:updatestatus) to keep track of the progress
