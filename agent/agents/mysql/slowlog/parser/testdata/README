slow000 is empty

slow001 is a most basic basic, normal slow log--nothing exotic.

slow002 is a basic slow log like slow001 but with more metrics, multi-line queries, etc.

slow003 starts with a blank line.  I guess this once messed up SlowLogParser.pm?

I don't know what's special about this slow004.

slow005 has a multi-line query with tabs in it.  A pathological case that
would probably break the parser is a query like:
  SELECT * FROM foo WHERE col = "Hello
  # Query_time: 10
  " LIMIT 1;
There's no easy way to detect that "# Query_time" is part of the query and
not part of the next event's header.

slow006 has the Schema: db metric _or_ use db; lines before the queries.
Schema value should be used for log.Event.Db is no use db; line is present.

slow007 has Schema: db1 _and_ use db2;.  db2 should be used.

slow008 has 4 interesting things (which makes it a poor test case since we're
testing many things at once):
  1) an admin command, e.g.: # administrator command: Quit;
  2) a SET NAMES query; SET <certain vars> are ignored
  3) No Time metrics
  4) IPs in the host metric, but we don't currently support these

slow011 contains rate limit

slow013 - Stack overflow bug due to meta lines.

slow014 - query line looks like header line.

slow015 - Line > bufio.MaxScanTokenSize = 64KiB https://jira.percona.com/browse/PCT-552

slow016 - Start in header

slow017 - Start in query

slow023 - Test db is not inherited and multiple "use" commands.

slow024 - Test header with invalid # Time or invalid # User lines
