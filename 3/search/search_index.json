By default, profiling is turned off as it can adversely affect the performance of the database server.</p> <p>Choose one of the following methods to enable profiling: </p> In MongoDB configuration file (Recommended)On CLIIn MongoDB shell (temporary) <p>This method ensures your settings persist across server restarts and system reboots. It\u2019s the recommended approach for production environments:</p> <ol> <li>Edit the configuration file (usually <code>/etc/mongod.conf</code>).</li> <li> <p>Add or modify the <code>operationProfiling</code> section in the configuration file. Pay close attention to indentation as YAML is whitespace-sensitive:</p> <p><pre><code>operationProfiling:\n    mode: all             \n    slowOpThresholdMs: 200\n    rateLimit: 100        \n</code></pre> These settings control the following:</p> <ul> <li><code>mode: all</code> - Collects data for all operations.</li> <li><code>slowOpThresholdMs: 200</code> - Marks operations exceeding 200ms as \u201cslow.\u201d</li> <li><code>rateLimit: 100</code> -  Limits profiling sampling rate (Percona Server for MongoDB only).</li> </ul> <p>For more information about profiling configuration options, see the MongoDB documentation and the Percona Server for MongoDB documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>Restart the <code>mongod</code> service using the appropriate command for your system. For example, for <code>systemd</code>:</p> <pre><code>systemctl restart mongod\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>Use this method when starting the MongoDB server manually:</p> <pre><code>mongod --dbpath=DATABASEDIR --profile 2 --slowms 200 --rateLimit 100\n</code></pre> <ul> <li><code>--dbpath</code>: The path to database files (usually <code>/var/lib/mongo</code>).</li> <li><code>--profile</code>: The MongoDB profiling level. A value of <code>2</code> tells the server to collect profiling data for all operations. To lower the load on the server, use a value of <code>1</code> to only record slow operations.</li> <li><code>--slowms</code>: An operation is classified as slow if it runs for longer than this number of milliseconds.</li> <li> <p><code>--rateLimit</code>: (Only available with Percona Server for MongoDB.) The sample rate of profiled queries. A value of <code>100</code> means sample every 100<sup>th</sup> fast query. (Read more)</p> <p>Caution</p> <p>Smaller values improve accuracy but can adversely affect the performance of your server.</p> </li> </ul> <p>This method enables profiling until the next server restart. Profiling must be enabled for each database you want to monitor. For example, to enable the profiler in the <code>testdb</code>, run this:</p> <pre><code>use testdb\ndb.setProfilingLevel(2, {slowms: 0})\n</code></pre> <p>If you have already added a service, you should remove it and re-add it after changing the profiling level.</p>"},{"location":"install-pmm/install-pmm-client/connect-database/mongodb.html#configure-query-source-for-mongodb","title":"Configure query source for MongoDB","text":"<p>PMM offers two methods for collecting MongoDB query analytics.
