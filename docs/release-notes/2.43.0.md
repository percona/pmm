Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## What's new in this release

PMM 2.43 brings a host of updates, including redesigned dashboards, new collectors and metrics, enhanced troubleshooting capabilities, strengthened security, and expanded platform support with official ARM compatibility for PMM Client.

Additionally, it features many bug fixes and performance enhancements to improve your user experience.

### MongoDB dashboard improvements and GA of recent experimental dashboard

This update introduces significant enhancements to MongoDB monitoring, focusing on redesigned dashboards, streamlined navigation, and general availability of previously experimental dashboards.

#### Redesigned dashboards

We've overhauled two critical MongoDB dashboards to provide more value, especially for complex, multi-environment setups:

- **Replica Set Summary**
- **Sharded Cluster Summary** (formerly Cluster Summary)

These dashboards now offer enhanced usability, improved insights, and optimized visualizations for complex environments. They focus on highlighting potential database issues for faster resolution and provide centralized, actionable insights without clutter.

#### General availability of Experimental dashboards

The redesigned dashboards, along with the following previously experimental dashboards, are now generally available:

- **MongoDB Oplog Details**
- **MongoDB Collection Overview**
- **Replica Set Summary**
- **Sharded Cluster Summary** (formerly Cluster Summary)

#### Accessing the new dashboards

The updated dashboards are in the **MongoDB** and **Dashboards** sections of the main menu. They replace the previous versions as the default dashboards for MongoDB monitoring.

The old dashboards have been moved to the **Experimental** folder and renamed with **(Old)** appended to their names. Future releases will remove these older versions.

#### Updated MongoDB menu structure

To complement the dashboard improvements, we've also restructured the MongoDB section on the main menu for better navigation and accessibility:

- Reorganized menu for a more intuitive navigation, prioritizing the three updated GA dashboards above.
- Decluttered view by moving older dashboards to the **Experimental** folder or removing them from the menu.
- Added **MongoDB Oplog Details**, **MongoDB Collection Overview**, and **MongoDB Instance Summary** to the main menu

We encourage you to start using the new dashboards to benefit from their enhanced monitoring capabilities. We also invite you to share your feedback in the [PMM forum](https://forums.percona.com/c/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm/percona-monitoring-and-management-pmm-v2/31).

### Repository changes for PMM: Transition to dedicated `pmm2-client` repository


Effective July 1, 2024, Percona has discontinued updates for the original Percona (https://repo.percona.com/percona/) and tools (https://repo.percona.com/tools/) repositories in favor of dedicated product repositories. This change streamlines our repository management and improves efficiency across our product ecosystem.

For PMM users, this means you can now access the most up-to-date and secure versions of PMM exclusively from the dedicated [repo.percona.com/pmm2-client](`pmm2-client`) repository. To facilitate a smooth transition to this repo, we have developed an automated script that:

1. Checks installed packages and their repositories
2. Identifies PMM-related packages that should be installed from the `pmm2-client` repository
3. Provides instructions for enabling the correct repository

To ensure your PMM installation remains secure and up-to-date, [download this script from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Percona-Lab/release-aux/main/scripts/check_percona_packages.py) and run it on your system.

For detailed instructions and more information about this change, check out [our recent blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/ensure-the-correct-repositories-are-enabled-for-percona-packages/) and [updated documentation]().

### Improved troubleshooting

We've enhanced our troubleshooting capabilities to provide you with better insights and more efficient problem-solving tools:

#### Enhanced PMM Server logs

The default number of log lines for each log file returned by `httsp://<pmm-server>/logs.zip` endpoint has been increased from 1,000 to 50,000.

Additionally, the endpoint now includes a customizable line-count parameter in the download URL, allowing you to specify a custom number of log lines or opt for unlimited log size. For more information, see the [API documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/logs).

#### Streamlined Kubernetes diagnostics 

New PMM client docker images now include essential troubleshooting tools:

- `tar` enables easier file transfer in and out of containers using the `kubectl cp` command.
- `curl` allows direct checking of exporters to verify their proper functioning.

### Improved security

This update addresses several security issues related to the GNU C Library (Glibc), specifically affecting the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd). Additionally, it resolves multiple security vulnerabilities by upgrading various third-party packages.

These enhancements strengthen the overall security of the PMM Server environment, although they do not directly impact PMM's core functionality.

### Official ARM support for PMM Client
With the growing adoption of ARM in data centers and cloud environments, we are excited to announce official support for ARM architecture in PMM Clients. This enables you to seamlessly monitor ARM-based infrastructure, including popular cloud instances and emerging ARM-powered servers.

Starting with version 2.43, PMM now includes pre-built binaries for ARM architecture. With this update, PMM Client features, such as `node_exporter` and `mysqld_exporter`, are fully supported and optimized for ARM platforms. Additionally, ARM-based PMM Clients seamlessly integrate with existing PMM Server installations, enabling unified monitoring across both x86 and ARM architectures.

#### Upgrading and getting started
If you have been compiling PMM on ARM manually, you can now upgrade to the 2.43 release for official support. The [Set up PMM Client topic](../setting-up/client/index.md) now also includes ARM-specific instructions for new installations.

### New MongoDB collector: CurrentOp

The MongoDB exporter now includes the **CurrentOp** collector, offering visibility into active operations, including the new `mongodb_currentop_query_uptime` metric.

To start the MongoDB exporter with the CurrentOp collector enabled, use the `--enable-all-collectors` flag when adding MongoDB services to your PMM instance:

```sh
pmm-admin add mongodb --enable-all-collectors ...
```

Specifying a limit with `--max-collections` for this collector is not necessary.

!!! note "Operation collection limitation"
To minimize impact on disk usage, the CurrentOp collector is designed to collect only operations that have been running for longer than 1 minute. This limitation helps focus on potentially problematic long-running operations while keeping data volume manageable.

For more information on MongoDB collectors and metrics, see the [pmm-admin commands documentation](../use/commamds/pmm-admin.md).

### Monitoring for Percona Backup for MongoDB
PMM now supports monitoring your Percona Backup for MongoDB (PBM) setup and provides PBM-related metrics such as `pbm-agent` statuses, PITR configuration, and backup statuses.
This is made possible via a new PBM collector in MongoDB exporter that gives you visibility to your PBM setup via these metrics:
- `mongodb_pbm_cluster_backup_configured`
- `mongodb_pbm_agent_status`
- `mongodb_pbm_cluster_pitr_backup_enabled`
- `mongodb_pbm_backup_size`
- `mongodb_pbm_backup_duration_seconds`

These metrics are enabled by default. If you're already running Percona Backup for MongoDB, you'll automatically receive these metrics without any additional configuration.

## Maintenance

### QAN update: Upgrade to `pg_query_go` v5 and impact on PostgreSQL 9.x

As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we have upgraded the `pg_query_go` package to version 5. This latest version helps parse PostgreSQL queries in QAN, provides improved functionality, and enables subsequent upgrades of important dependencies.

However, with this change, QAN will no longer be able to list PostgreSQL database tables for versions 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. Since all PostgreSQL 9.x versions have already reached their end-of-life status, we recommend upgrading to a supported version of PostgreSQL.

If you're looking to upgrade, you can easily [install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html).
