Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## What's new in this release

This release introduces redesigned MongoDB dashboards that have reached General Availability (GA) status, along with an improved navigation structure for MongoDB monitoring in PMM...

### Redesigned MongoDB dashboards now generally available with improved navigation


This update includes significant improvements to MongoDB monitoring focused on two key areas: the general availability (GA) of redesigned dashboards and a streamlined navigation structure for easier access to important dashboards.

#### Redesigned dashboards

The following MongoDB dashboards, previously in Experimental status, have been redesigned and are now generally available:

- **MongoDB Instance Summary**
- **Replica Set Summary**
- **Sharded Cluster Summary** (formerly Cluster Summary)
  
These dashboards include enhancements that make the dashboards more  valuable for complex, multi-environment setups:

- **Enhanced usability and insights**: Intuitive designs with improved filtering and comprehensive metrics
- **Focus on database issues**: Improved visualizations, highlighting potential problems for faster resolution.
- **Optimization for complex environments**: Easier monitoring across multiple MongoDB instances, replica sets, and sharded clusters.
- **Centralized, actionable insights**: Key metrics and visualizations providing critical information without clutter.

##### Accessing the new dashboards

The updated dashboards are now available in the **MongoDB** and **Dashboards** sections in the main menu, replacing the previous versions as the default dashboards for MongoDB monitoring.

The old dashboards have been moved to the **Experimental** folder and renamed with **(Old)** appended to their names. These older versions will be removed in future releases.

#### Updated MongoDB menu structure

To complement the dashboard improvements, we've also restructured the MongoDB section on the main menu for better navigation and accessibility:

- Reorganized menu for a more intuitive navigation, prioritizing the three updated GA dashboards above.
- The previously experimental **MongoDB Oplog Details** and **MongoDB Collection Overview** dashboards have been moved out of the **Experimental** folder and are now included in the main menu as generally available (GA) dashboards.
- Decluttered view by moving older dashboards to the **Experimental** folder or removing them from the menu.

We encourage you to transition to the new dashboards to take advantage of their improved monitoring capabilities and to share your feedback in the PMM forum.

### Repository changes for PMM: Transition to dedicated `pmm2-client` repository


Effective July 1, 2024, Percona has discontinued updates for the original Percona (https://repo.percona.com/percona/) and tools (https://repo.percona.com/tools/) repositories in favor of dedicated product repositories. This change streamlines our repository management and improves efficiency across our product ecosystem.

For PMM users, this means you can now access the most up-to-date and secure versions of PMM exclusively from the dedicated [repo.percona.com/pmm2-client](`pmm2-client`) repository. To facilitate a smooth transition to this repo, we have developed an automated script that:

1. Checks installed packages and their repositories
2. Identifies PMM-related packages that should be installed from the `pmm2-client` repository
3. Provides instructions for enabling the correct repository

To ensure your PMM installation remains secure and up-to-date, [download this script from GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Percona-Lab/release-aux/main/scripts/check_percona_packages.py) and run it on your system.

For detailed instructions and more information about this change, check out [our recent blog post](https://www.percona.com/blog/ensure-the-correct-repositories-are-enabled-for-percona-packages/) and [updated documentation]().

### Official ARM support for PMM Client
With the growing adoption of ARM in data centers and cloud environments, we are excited to announce official support for ARM architecture in PMM Clients. This enables you to seamlessly monitor ARM-based infrastructure, including popular cloud instances and emerging ARM-powered servers.

Starting with version 2.43, PMM now includes pre-built binaries for ARM architecture. With this update, PMM Client features, such as `node_exporter` and `mysqld_exporter`, are fully supported and optimized for ARM platforms. Additionally, ARM-based PMM Clients seamlessly integrate with existing PMM Server installations, enabling unified monitoring across both x86 and ARM architectures.

#### Upgrading and getting started
If you have been compiling PMM on ARM manually, you can now upgrade to the 2.43 release for official support. The [Set up PMM Client topic](../setting-up/client/index.md) now also includes ARM-specific instructions for new installations.

### New MongoDB collector: CurrentOp

The MongoDB exporter now includes the **CurrentOp** collector, offering visibility into active operations, including the new `mongodb_currentop_query_uptime` metric.

To start the MongoDB exporter with the CurrentOp collector enabled, use the `--enable-all-collectors` flag when adding MongoDB services to your PMM instance:

```sh
pmm-admin add mongodb --enable-all-collectors ...
```

Specifying a limit with `--max-collections` for this collector is not necessary.

!!! note "Operation collection limitation"
    To minimize impact on disk usage, the CurrentOp collector is designed to collect only operations that have been running for longer than 1 minute. This limitation helps focus on potentially problematic long-running operations while keeping data volume manageable.

For more information on MongoDB collectors and metrics, see the [pmm-admin commands documentation](../use/commamds/pmm-admin.md).



## Improvements

- [PMM-13133](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13133) - 

- [PMM-13054](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13054) - The default number of log lines for each log file returned by `httsp://<pmm-server>/logs.zip` endpoint has been increased from 1,000 to 50,000. 

Additionally, the endpoint now includes a customizable line-count parameter in the download URL, allowing you to specify a custom number of log lines or opt for unlimited log size. For more information, see the [API documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/logs).

- [PMM-13159](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13159) - We have removed the experimental MongoDB **Collection Details** dashboard from PMM. You can now find up-to-date collection information on the new Mongo **Cluster Summary** dashboard, which provides a more comprehensive and accurate view of MongoDB collection metrics. 

If you have been using the **Collection Details** dashboard, make sure to now check the new **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard for similar information.


## Maintenance

### QAN update: Upgrade to `pg_query_go` v5 and impact on PostgreSQL 9.x

As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we have upgraded the `pg_query_go` package to version 5. This latest version helps parse PostgreSQL queries in QAN, provides improved functionality, and enables subsequent upgrades of important dependencies.

However, with this change, QAN will no longer be able to list PostgreSQL database tables for versions 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. Since all PostgreSQL 9.x versions have already reached their end-of-life status, we recommend upgrading to a supported version of PostgreSQL.

If you're looking to upgrade, you can easily [install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html). 

### Fixed issues

- [PMM-13246](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13246) - Addressed four security vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to the GNU C Library (Glibc), specifically affecting the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd):

   - [CVE-2024-33599](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33599)
   - [CVE-2024-33600](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33600)
   - [CVE-2024-33601](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33601)
   - [CVE-2024-33602](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33602) 
 
 While these vulnerabilities did not directly impact PMM's core functionality, fixing them enhanced the overall security of the PMM Server environment. 

- [PMM-12451](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-12451) and [PMM-13017](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13017) - Resolved an issue with parsing JSON objects into the correct data types and aligned the explain functionality with the official MongoDB client. These updates enhance consistency with MongoDB's native tools and provide improved performance insights.

- [PMM-13071](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13071) - The **Explain** tab on the Query Analytics (QAN) page now properly handles unsupported MongoDB query types. For operations like `INSERT`, which donâ€™t support explain functionality, you will now see a clear message saying that the operation is not explainable. This replaces the previous, confusing error message about duplicate BSON fields, offering more accurate feedback in QAN.
