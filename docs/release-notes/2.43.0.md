## Improvements

- [PMM-13133](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13133) - 

- [PMM-13054](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13054) - The default number of log lines for each log file returned by `httsp://<pmm-server>/logs.zip` endpoint has been increased from 1,000 to 50,000. 

Additionally, the endpoint now includes a customizable line-count parameter in the download URL, allowing you to specify a custom number of log lines or opt for unlimited log size. For more information, see the [API documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/logs).

- [PMM-13159](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13159) - We have removed the experimental MongoDB **Collection Details** dashboard from PMM. You can now find up-to-date collection information on the new Mongo **Cluster Summary** dashboard, which provides a more comprehensive and accurate view of MongoDB collection metrics. 

If you have been using the **Collection Details** dashboard, make sure to now check the new **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard for similar information.


## Maintenance

### QAN update: Upgrade to `pg_query_go` v5 and impact on PostgreSQL 9.x

As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we have upgraded the `pg_query_go` package to version 5. This latest version helps parse PostgreSQL queries in QAN, provides improved functionality, and enables subsequent upgrades of important dependencies.

However, with this change, QAN will no longer be able to list PostgreSQL database tables for versions 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. Since all PostgreSQL 9.x versions have already reached their end-of-life status, we recommend upgrading to a supported version of PostgreSQL.

If you're looking to upgrade, you can easily [install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html).
