Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database monitoring, management, and observability solution for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.

It enables you to observe the health of your database systems, explore new patterns in their behavior, troubleshoot them and execute database management operations regardless of whether your databases are located on-premises or in the cloud.

## What's new in this release

This release introduces this and that

## Release highlights

### MongoDB dashboard updates: now generally available (GA)

We are pleased to announce that the experimental MongoDB dashboards introduced in our previous release have now reached General Availability (GA). Along with this, weâ€™ve made significant updates to the MongoDB menu structure in PMM, enhancing navigation and accessibility for monitoring features:

1. **MongoDB Instance Summary dashboard**  
   - Redesigned for comprehensive instance monitoring, featuring new panels and metrics for deeper insights.

2. **MongoDB Replica Set Summary dashboard** extensively revamped with:
     - Enhanced **Node Summary** section now displays information for all nodes in a replica set simultaneously, allowing for easier comparison and monitoring of multi-node setups
     - An improved **Overview** row displaying replica set roles (Primary, Secondary, Arbiter) alongside key metrics.
     - Reorganized node information into separate, collapsible rows for CPU usage, CPU saturation, Disk I/O, and Network traffic, improving readability and organization for setups with multiple nodes
     - A new **Details** row featuring panels for top collections and command operations.
     - An added **Collection Details** row showing sizes and counts.
     - Enhanced replication section with more detailed metrics.
     - Individual performance rows providing in-depth, node-specific metrics with clear role indicators. 
     - Improved visualization of replica set roles, including dynamic role display in the **State** panel and chart titles for easier identification and troubleshooting.

3. **MongoDB Sharded Cluster Summary dashboard** (previously **MongoDB Cluster Summary**)  
   - New layout with additional filters and panels for comprehensive cluster health monitoring.
   - Enhanced version information display, , now including MongoS (router) versions alongside config and shard node versions.
   - Improved visibility of all components within the sharded cluster architecture,  with MongoS instances now detected and displayed as part of the cluster.

4. **MongoDB Collections Overview dashboard**: Improved to address user feedback:
     - Enhanced filtering: The "instance level" charts now correctly apply database and replica set filters
    - Refined **Top 5 Hottest Collections** charts: These now display data specific to the selected database and replica set, improving consistency with user selections
    - Clearer data representation: Better separation between global and database-specific metrics for improved clarity

5. **Updated MongoDB menu structure**  
   - Reorganized the MongoDB section for better navigation and accessibility. The new structure highlights the three updated dashboards above and includes two new experimental dashboards: **Experimental MongoDB Oplog Details** and **Experimental MongoDB Collection Overview**.
   - Outdated dashboards have been moved to the Experimental folder or removed from the menu.

These updates bring improved filtering, more detailed metrics, and enhanced visualization of MongoDB states and operations, allowing for quicker diagnostics and centralized KPI views.

### Accessing the new dashboards

The updated dashboards are now available in the MongoDB and Dashboards sections within PMM, replacing the previous versions as the default dashboards for MongoDB monitoring.

The old dashboards have been moved to the Experimental folder and renamed with **(Old)** appended to their names. These older versions will be removed in future releases. We encourage you to transition to the new dashboards for better monitoring capabilities and share your feedback in the PMM forum.

### New MongoDB collector: CurrentOp

The MongoDB exporter now includes the **CurrentOp** collector, offering visibility into active operations, including the new `mongodb_currentop_query_uptime` metric.

To start the MongoDB exporter with the CurrentOp collector enabled, use the `--enable-all-collectors` flag when adding MongoDB services to your PMM instance:

```sh
pmm-admin add mongodb --enable-all-collectors ...
```

Specifying a limit with `--max-collections` for this collector is not necessary.

!!! note "Operation collection limitation"
    To minimize impact on disk usage, the CurrentOp collector is designed to collect only operations that have been running for longer than 1 minute. This limitation helps focus on potentially problematic long-running operations while keeping data volume manageable.

For more information on MongoDB collectors and metrics, see the [pmm-admin commands documentation](../use/commamds/pmm-admin.md).


## Improvements

- [PMM-13133](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13133) - 

- [PMM-13054](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13054) - The default number of log lines for each log file returned by `httsp://<pmm-server>/logs.zip` endpoint has been increased from 1,000 to 50,000. 

Additionally, the endpoint now includes a customizable line-count parameter in the download URL, allowing you to specify a custom number of log lines or opt for unlimited log size. For more information, see the [API documentation](https://percona-pmm.readme.io/reference/logs).

- [PMM-13159](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13159) - We have removed the experimental MongoDB **Collection Details** dashboard from PMM. You can now find up-to-date collection information on the new Mongo **Cluster Summary** dashboard, which provides a more comprehensive and accurate view of MongoDB collection metrics. 

If you have been using the **Collection Details** dashboard, make sure to now check the new **MongoDB Cluster Summary** dashboard for similar information.


## Maintenance

### QAN update: Upgrade to `pg_query_go` v5 and impact on PostgreSQL 9.x

As part of our ongoing maintenance efforts, we have upgraded the `pg_query_go` package to version 5. This latest version helps parse PostgreSQL queries in QAN, provides improved functionality, and enables subsequent upgrades of important dependencies.

However, with this change, QAN will no longer be able to list PostgreSQL database tables for versions 9.4, 9.5, and 9.6. Since all PostgreSQL 9.x versions have already reached their end-of-life status, we recommend upgrading to a supported version of PostgreSQL.

If you're looking to upgrade, you can easily [install the latest version of Percona Distribution for PostgreSQL](https://docs.percona.com/postgresql/16/installing.html). 

### Fixed issues

- [PMM-13246](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/PMM-13246) - Addressed four security vulnerabilities (CVEs) related to the GNU C Library (Glibc), specifically affecting the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd):

   - [CVE-2024-33599](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33599)
   - [CVE-2024-33600](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33600)
   - [CVE-2024-33601](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33601)
   - [CVE-2024-33602](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-33602) 
 
 While these vulnerabilities did not directly impact PMM's core functionality, fixing them enhanced the overall security of the PMM Server environment.
