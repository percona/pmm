# About PMM

<i info>:material-information: Info:</i> This is the documentation for the latest release, **PMM {{release}}** Beta. See the [Release Notes](release-notes/3.0.0_Beta.md) for details.

Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an open source database observability, monitoring, and management tool for use with MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and the servers on which they run. It enables you to view node- to single-query performance metrics for all of your databases in a single place. 

- PMM is designed to facilitate seamless access to comprehensive performance metrics for all the nodes and queries associated with your databases via a user-friendly interface.
- PMM is highly versatile and can be deployed behind a firewall, on the cloud, or across hybrid platforms. 
- It is a complete package comprising in-house and third-party components and tools for all your monitoring requirements.
- To set up basic PMM, you just need to install a [server](reference/index.md#server) and a [client](reference/index.md#client) on each system you intend to monitor.
