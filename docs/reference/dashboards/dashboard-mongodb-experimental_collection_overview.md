# Experimental MongoDB Collection Overview

!!! caution alert alert-warning "Disclaimer"
    This is an Experimental Dashboard that is not part of the official Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) deployment and might be updated. We ship this Dashboard to obtain feedback from our users.

This realtime dashboard contains panels of data about the Hottest Collections in the MongoDB database.

The Instance level includes two panels, one for the **Hottest Collections by Read (Total)** and the **Hottest Collections by Write (total)**. 

The next panel displays data at the **Database Level**, where you can view MongoDB metrics such as **Commands**, **Inserts**, **Updates**, **Removes**, and **Getmore**.

The last panel shows the number of operations in the chosen database.
