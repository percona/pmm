# Manage PMM dashboards

PMM offers various types of dashboards for monitoring and managing the performance of your databases:

1. **Standard dashboards**: include database overviews, database-specific dashboards, query analytics, system-level metrics, replication, and high availability dashboards. These offer comprehensive insights into various aspects of your database environment.
2. **Experimental dashboards**: newer, or less stable dashboards that usually introduce new metrics or visualizations or monitoring approaches.
3. **Custom dashboards**: user-created dashboards tailored to specific metrics or needs, allowing you to combine data from different sources for customized monitoring and analysis.

Standard and experimental dashboards are "provisioned dashboards", meaning they are:

- created by PMM out of the box based on predefined configurations to ensure consistency across deployments.
- protected from editing through the UI to prevent accidental modifications. Trying to modify these dashboards via the UI will result in a `Cannot save provisioned dashboard` error.
- replaced during PMM upgrades, to ensure they are always up-to-date with the latest version. Any manual changes will be overwritten.

Remember:

- Always work with cloned copies of PMM dashboards.
- Changes to original PMM dashboards will be lost during updates.
- Experimental dashboards may change more frequently, therefore consider re-cloning them after upgrades.

## Create dashboard folders

Folders help you organize and group PMM dashboards, making it easier to manage numerous dashboards and accommodate multiple teams using the same PMM instance.

To create a dashboard folder (requires **Admin** privileges):

1. From the side menu, go to <i class="uil uil-plus"></i> **Dashboards > New > New folder**.

3. Click **Make editable**, then at the top right of the page, click **Save as** to create a copy.
4. Name your copy and choose the location where you want to save it.
