# Upgrade PMM Server on AWS

## Change public IP address

To assign a public IP address for an Amazon EC2 instance, follow these steps:
{.power-number}

1. Allocate Elastic IP address

    ![!image](../../_images/aws-marketplace.pmm.ec2.ip.allocate.png)

2. Associate Elastic IP address with a Network interface ID of your EC2 instance

    If you associate an Elastic IP address to an instance that already has an Elastic IP address associated, this previously associated Elastic IP address will be disassociated but still allocated to your account.

## Upgrade EC2 instance class

Upgrading to a larger EC2 instance class is supported by PMM provided you follow the instructions from the [AWS manual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-resize.html). The PMM AMI image uses a distinct EBS volume for the PMM data volume which permits independent resizing of the EC2 instance without impacting the EBS volume.
{.power-number}

1. Open the Amazon EC2 console.

2. In the navigation pane, choose PMM Server Instances.

3. Select the instance and choose Actions, Instance state, Stop instance.

4. In the Change instance type dialog box, select the instance type that you want.

5. Choose Apply to accept the new settings and start the stopped instance.

## Expand PMM Data EBS Volume

The PMM data volume is mounted as an XFS formatted volume on top of an LVM volume. There are two ways to increase this volume size:
{.power-number}

1. Add a new disk via EC2 console or API, and expand the LVM volume to include the new disk volume.

2. Expand existing EBS volume and grow the LVM volume.

## Expand existing EBS volume

To expand the existing EBS volume for increased capacity, follow these steps.
{.power-number}

1. Expand the disk from AWS Console/CLI to the desired capacity.

2. Login to the PMM EC2 instance and verify that the disk capacity has increased. For example, if you have expanded your disk from 16G to 32G, `dmesg` output should look like below:

    ```txt
    [  535.994494] xvdb: detected capacity change from 17179869184 to 34359738368
    ```

3. You can check information about volume groups and logical volumes with the `vgs` and `lvs` commands:

    ```sh
    vgs
    ```

    ```txt
    VG     #PV #LV #SN Attr   VSize  VFree
    DataVG   1   2   0 wz--n- <16.00g    0
    ```

    ```sh
    lvs
    ```

    ```txt
    LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
    DataLV   DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool        1.74
    ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz--  15.96g 1.39  1.29
    ```

4. Now we can use the `lsblk` command to see that our disk size has been identified by the kernel correctly, but LVM2 is not yet aware of the new size. We can use `pvresize` to make sure the PV device reflects the new size. Once `pvresize` is executed, we can see that the VG has the new free space available.

    ```sh
    lsblk | grep xvdb
    ```

    ```txt
    xvdb                      202:16 0 32G 0 disk
    ```

    ```sh
    pvscan
    ```

    ```txt
    PV /dev/xvdb   VG DataVG    lvm2 [<16.00 GiB / 0    free]
    Total: 1 [<16.00 GiB] / in use: 1 [<16.00 GiB] / in no VG: 0 [0   ]
    ```

    ```sh
    pvresize /dev/xvdb
    ```

    ```txt
    Physical volume "/dev/xvdb" changed
    1 physical volume(s) resized / 0 physical volume(s) not resized
    ```

    ```sh
    pvs
    ```

    ```txt
    PV         VG     Fmt  Attr PSize   PFree
    /dev/xvdb  DataVG lvm2 a--  <32.00g 16.00g
    ```

5. We then extend our logical volume. Since the PMM image uses thin provisioning, we need to extend both the pool and the volume:

    ```sh
    lvs
    ```

    ```txt
    LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool    Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
    DataLV   DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool        1.77
    ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz--  15.96g                 1.42   1.32
    ```

    ```sh
    lvextend /dev/mapper/DataVG-ThinPool -l 100%VG
    ```

    ```txt
    Size of logical volume DataVG/ThinPool_tdata changed from 16.00 GiB (4096 extents) to 31.96 GiB (8183 extents).
    Logical volume DataVG/ThinPool_tdata successfully resized.
    ```

    ```sh
    lvs
    ```

    ```txt
    LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool    Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
    DataLV   DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool        1.77
    ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz--  31.96g                 0.71   1.71
    ```

6. Once the pool and volumes have been extended, we need to now extend the thin volume to consume the newly available space. In this example we’ve grown available space to almost 32GB, and already consumed 12GB, so we’re extending an additional 19GB:

    ```sh
    lvs
    ```

    ```txt
    LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool    Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
    DataLV   DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <12.80g ThinPool        1.77
    ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz--  31.96g                 0.71   1.71
    ```

    ```sh
    lvextend /dev/mapper/DataVG-DataLV -L +19G
    ```

    ```txt
    Size of logical volume DataVG/DataLV changed from <12.80 GiB (3276 extents) to <31.80 GiB (8140 extents).
    Logical volume DataVG/DataLV successfully resized.
    ```

    ```sh
    lvs
    ```

    ```txt
    LV       VG     Attr       LSize   Pool    Origin Data%  Meta% Move Log Cpy%Sync Convert
    DataLV   DataVG Vwi-aotz-- <31.80g ThinPool        0.71
    ThinPool DataVG twi-aotz--  31.96g                 0.71   1.71
    ```

7. We then expand the XFS file system to reflect the new size using `xfs_growfs`, and confirm the file system is accurate using the `df` command.

    ```sh
    df -h /srv
    ```

    ```txt
    Filesystem                  Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/DataVG-DataLV    13G 249M   13G   2% /srv
    ```

    ```sh
    xfs_growfs /srv
    ```

    ```txt
    meta-data=/dev/mapper/DataVG-DataLV isize=512    agcount=103, agsize=32752 blks
             =                          sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
             =                          crc=1        finobt=0 spinodes=0
    data     =                          bsize=4096   blocks=3354624, imaxpct=25
             =                          sunit=16     swidth=16 blks
    naming   =version 2                 bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
    log      =internal                  bsize=4096   blocks=768, version=2
             =                          sectsz=512   sunit=16 blks, lazy-count=1
    realtime =none                      extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
    data blocks changed from 3354624 to 8335360
    ```

    ```sh
    df -h /srv
    ```

    ```txt
    Filesystem                 Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/DataVG-DataLV   32G 254M   32G   1% /srv
    ```

## Expand Amazon EBS root volume

To expand the Amazon EBS root volume:
{.power-number}

1. Expand the disk from AWS Console/CLI to the desired capacity.

2. Login to the PMM EC2 instance and verify that the disk capacity has increased. For example, if you have expanded disk from 8G to 10G, `dmesg` output should look like below:

    ```sh
    # dmesg | grep "capacity change"
    [63175.044762] nvme0n1: detected capacity change from 8589934592 to 10737418240
    ```

3. Use the `lsblk` command to see that our disk size has been identified by the kernel correctly, but LVM2 is not yet aware of the new size.

    ```sh
    # lsblk
    NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    nvme0n1                   259:1    0    10G  0 disk
    └─nvme0n1p1               259:2    0     8G  0 part /
    ...
    ```

4. For volumes that have a partition, such as the root volume shown in the previous step, use the `growpart` command to extend the partition.

    ```sh
    # growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
    CHANGED: partition=1 start=2048 old: size=16775168 end=16777216 new: size=20969439 end=20971487
    ```

5. To verify that the partition reflects the increased volume size, use the `lsblk` command again.

    ```txt
    # lsblk
    NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
    nvme0n1                   259:1    0    10G  0 disk
    └─nvme0n1p1               259:2    0    10G  0 part /
    ...
    ```

6. Extend the XFS file system on the root volume by `xfs_growfs` command. I

    ```sh
    # xfs_growfs -d /
    meta-data=/dev/nvme0n1p1         isize=512    agcount=4, agsize=524224 blks
             =                       sectsz=512   attr=2, projid32bit=1
             =                       crc=1        finobt=0 spinodes=0
    data     =                       bsize=4096   blocks=2096896, imaxpct=25
             =                       sunit=0      swidth=0 blks
    naming   =version 2              bsize=4096   ascii-ci=0 ftype=1
    log      =internal               bsize=4096   blocks=2560, version=2
             =                       sectsz=512   sunit=0 blks, lazy-count=1
    realtime =none                   extsz=4096   blocks=0, rtextents=0
    data blocks changed from 2096896 to 2621120
    ```

7. Verify that file system reflects the increased volume size

    ```sh
    # df -hT /
    Filesystem     Type  Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
    /dev/nvme0n1p1 xfs    10G  5,6G  4,5G  56% /
    ```
