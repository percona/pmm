1. Create a backup before upgrading, as downgrades are not possible. Therefore, reverting to a previous version requires an backup made prior to the upgrade.

2. Verify your current PMM version: Check your current PMM version by navigating to **PMM Configuration > Updates** or by running the following command: 

    ```sh
    podman exec -it pmm-server \
    curl -ku admin:admin https://localhost/v1/version
    ```

1. [Back up your data](../install-pmm/install-pmm-server/baremetal/podman/backup_container_podman.md).

2. Update PMM tag by editing `~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.env` file and running the following command to set the latest release version:

    ```sh
    sed -i "s/PMM_IMAGE=.*/PMM_IMAGE=docker.io/percona/pmm-server:3.0.0/g" ~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.env
    ```

3. Pre-pull the new image to ensure a faster restart:

    ```sh
    source ~/.config/systemd/user/pmm-server.env
    podman pull ${PMM_IMAGE}:${PMM_TAG}
    ```

4. Restart PMM Server:

    ```sh
    systemctl --user restart pmm-server
    ```

5. After the upgrade, verify that PMM Server is running correctly:

    ```sh
    podman ps | grep pmm-server
    ```

6. Check the logs for any errors:

    ```sh
    podman logs pmm-server
    ```
