4. Click **Save Changes**.


## Set a role as default

When a user signs in to PMM for the first time and the user has no role assigned, the user is automatically assigned the *Default* role. For administrators, the default role provides a convenient way to configure default permissions for new users.


To set a role as default, do the following:
{.power-number}

1. From the **Main** menu, navigate to <i class="uil uil-cog"></i> **Configuration → Access Roles**. The **Access Roles** tab opens.

2. On the role you want to set as default, click the **ellipsis (three vertical dots) → set as default** in the **Options** column.
