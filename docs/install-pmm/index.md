## Install PMM Server

Install and run at least one PMM Server. Choose from the following options:

!!! summary alert alert-info "ARM support"
     PMM Server is not currently available as a native ARM64 build. For ARM-based systems, consider using the Docker or Podman installation methods, which can run x86_64 images via emulation on ARM platforms.

## Install PMM Client

Install and run PMM Client on every node where there is a service you want to monitor. PMM Client now supports both x86_64 and ARM64 architectures.

The installation choices are:

    === "With Docker" 

     [Docker installation](client/index.md#docker) simplifies deployment across different architectures and automatically selects the appropriate image for your architecture (x86_64 or ARM64).=p][\;]

    === "Native installation"      

    - [Linux package](client/index.md#package-manager). Use `apt`, `apt-get`, `dnf`, `yum`. The package manager automatically selects the correct version for your architecture.

    - [Binary package](client/index.md#binary-packa): Download the appropriate `.tar.gz` file for your architecture (x86_64 or ARM64).

!!! hint alert "Tips"
    Both binary installation and Docker containers can be run without root permissions. When installing on ARM-based systems, ensure you're using ARM64-compatible versions. Performance may vary between architectures.

## Add services
On each PMM Client instance, configure the nodes and services you want to monitor.
