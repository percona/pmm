## Breaking API changes

### Removed database ID prefixes

We have removed prefixes from database record identifiers (IDs) in PMM to improve API compatibility with REST and to simplify ID handling.
For example, an ID that was previously `/agent_id/7cae8a44-8210-4f00-a679-764fa8303ee8` is now simply `7cae8a44-8210-4f00-a679-764fa8303ee8`.

This change affects various components, including nodes, agents, services, and backup-related entities. As a result:

- Database identifiers are now represented as plain UUIDs without prefixes: `/node_id/`, `/agent_id/`, `/service_id/`, etc.
- API endpoints using IDs as path parameters now use a new format
- Exporter passwords (previously identical to the prefixed `agent_id` value) have changed
- Metrics labels, that used `agent_id` value, have been updated

#### Impact

Make sure to update any custom scripts, integrations, or alerts that rely on the old exporter ID format to ensure compatibility with this new structure.

### Simplified boolean feature controls

We have replaced the so-called `dual booleans` with single booleans for feature toggles in our API to improve usability and simplify code implementation. Additionally, we've made primitive values `optional` to enhance type handling.

This change affects various API endpoints that control feature toggles and how we handle primitive types. As a result:

- Feature states are now represented by a single enabled boolean key
- API requests to toggle features now use a new, simplified format
- Responses from the API will consistently use the new format
- The API can now distinguish between unset values and empty/zero values for primitive types
- Slices and maps continue to use their standard representations without wrappers

#### Example of new format

```json
{"enable_feature": true}  // To enable a feature
{"enable_feature": false} // To disable a feature
```

#### Impact

Ensure you update any custom scripts, integrations, or frontend code that interact with feature toggles in the API. 

Review your codebase for any logic that relies on the previous dual boolean system and update accordingly.

### Consistent field emission in API responses

We have updated our API to consistently emit all fields in responses, including those with default or zero values. This change improves API clarity and affects how API responses are structured. As a result:

- All API responses now include fields with zero or default values
- API documentation accurately reflects actual API responses
- Responses provide a more complete picture of available settings and their current values
- It's now easier to differentiate between unset fields and those with default or empty values

#### Example of new response format

```json
{
  "settings": {
    "updates_enabled": true,
    "telemetry_enabled": true,
    "metrics_resolutions": {
      "hr": "5s",
      "mr": "10s",
      "lr": "60s"
    },
    "data_retention": "2592000s",
    "ssh_key": "",
    "aws_partitions": ["aws"],
    "advisor_enabled": true,
    "platform_email": "",
    "alerting_enabled": true,
    "pmm_public_address": "",
    "advisor_run_intervals": {
      "standard_interval": "86400s",
      "rare_interval": "280800s",
      "frequent_interval": "14400s"
    },
    "backup_management_enabled": true,
    "azurediscover_enabled": false,
    "connected_to_platform": false,
    "default_role_id": 1
  }
}
```

#### Impact

Ensure you review and update any custom scripts, integrations, or code that parse API responses. The new format provides more consistent and complete information, but may require updates to existing parsing logic.

Be aware that API responses will be more verbose, including all defined fields regardless of their values. This change improves clarity but may slightly increase the size of API responses.

### Removed Inventory API topics from documentation

We have streamlined our API documentation by removing most of the low-level Inventory API sections and focusing instead on the Management API for inventory-related tasks. If you are using the Inventory API in your integrations or scripts, make sure to review the updated API documentation for the correct endpoints.

### Streamlined API endpoints for Services, Nodes, and Agents

We have simplified our API structure by consolidated multiple endpoints into single, versatile endpoints for Services, Nodes, and Agents:

#### Services API update

A new `POST /v1/inventory/services` endpoint replaces individual service-specific endpoints. You can now specify the service type (mysql, mongodb, postgresql, proxysql, haproxy, external) as a top-level property in the request payload. For example:

```json
{
  "mysql": {
    "service_name": "mysql-sales-db-prod-1",
    "node_id": "pmm-server",
    "address": "209.0.25.100",
    "port": 3306
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```

#### Nodes API update

Similarly, `POST /v1/inventory/nodes` now handles all node types (generic, container, remote, remote_rds, remote_azure). The node type is specified in the request payload:

```json
{
  "generic": {
    "node_name": "mysql-sales-db-prod-1",
    "region": "us-east-1",
    "az": "us-east-1a",
    "address": "209.0.25.100"
    // ... other properties
  }
}
```

#### Agents API update

The Agents API follows the same pattern, with a single endpoint for all agent types - `POST /v1/inventory/agents`. The agent type is specified as the top-level property in the request payload:

```json
{
  "mysqld_exporter": {
    "pmm_agent_id": "pmm-server",
    "service_id": "13519ec9-eedc-4d21-868c-582e146e1d0e",
    "username":  "mysql-prod-user",
    "password":  "mysql-prod-pass",
    "listen_port": 33060,
    "custom_labels": {
      "department":  "sales",
      "environment": "sales-prod",
      "replication_set": "db-sales-prod-1-rs1",
      "cluster": "db-sales-prod-1"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Impact

Update your API calls to use the new consolidated endpoints. Review the updated API documentation in the Swagger UI of your PMM instance for the new request formats.
