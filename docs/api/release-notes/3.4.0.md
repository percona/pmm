Here are the key API changes in the PMM 3.4.0 API:

### RDS Instance ID support
This fixes an issue where an optional `instance_id` parameter provided to `POST /v1/management/services` endpoint was saved in the "address" field. This enhancement addresses an API inconsistency where PMM would modify node addresses in the response, breaking automation tools.

You can now record the actual AWS RDS Instance ID in PMM, making it easier to match monitored instances with their corresponding resources in the AWS console.

### Affected endpoints

- POST /v1/management/services - `instance_id` parameter is persisted without modification
- GET /v1/management/services - Returns `instance_id` values for RDS nodes


### Example request
```json
{
  "node_name": "production-rds",
  "address": "mydb.cluster-xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
  "service_name": "production-mysql-01",
  "instance_id": "production-mysql-01",
  "engine": "DISCOVER_RDS_MYSQL",
  "port": 3306
}
```

### Example response

```
{
  "node": {
    "node_id": "a1c867d1-c464-49a5-baf7-fb2366c6b64b",
    "node_name": "production-rds",
    "address": "mydb.cluster-xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "instance_id": "production-mysql-01"
  },
  "mysql": {
    "service_id": "937db0a3-cace-4524-be4d-071e0d4f0e78",
    "service_name": "production-mysql-01",
    "address": "mydb.cluster-xyz.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com",
    "port": 3306
  }
}
```

### Impact

This enhancement is backward compatible. The `instance_id` field is optional, existing integrations continue working, and RDS node addresses now stay consistent between requests and responses.
