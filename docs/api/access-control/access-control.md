## Overview

Access Control in PMM can be used to restrict access to individual metrics.  
Access Control is in **tech preview** and needs to be enabled manually from PMM settings before it can be used.

Once enabled, restricting access to metrics can be performed by:

1. Creating a Percona role
2. Assigning the role to a user

### Create a Percona role

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost/v1/role/Create" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic xxx" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
        "title": "My custom role",
        "filter": "{environment=\"staging\"}"
      }'
```

The `filter` parameter is a [PromQL query](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) restricting access to the specified metrics.  
Full access can be provided by specifying an empty `filter` field.

### Assign a Percona role

Users can be assigned roles by using the `/v1/role/Assign` API.  
The endpoint assigns new roles to a user. Other roles, that may have been assigned to the user previously, stay intact.

```shell
curl -X POST "http://localhost/v1/role/Assign" \
     -H "Authorization: Basic xxx" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
        "user_id": 1,
        "role_ids": [2, 3, 4]
      }'
```
