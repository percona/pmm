To get the most of PMM, you need to keep your PMM Server up-to-date.

Here are the main methods to achieve it:

1. [Check for upgrade](ref:checkupdates) to see is there is an upgrade available
2. [Start upgrade](ref:startupdate) to start the process if a new version is available
3. [Check progress](ref:checkupdates) to keep track of the progress and see the logs
