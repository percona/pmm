Percona Monitoring and Management (PMM) is an industry leading tool for helping Devs, DevOps, and DBA's make sense of and take action on their database environments. While you can accomplish many tasks using either the PMM user interface or CLI, leveraging the API allows you to integrate it more easily into your broader technology infrastructure.

This guide is designed to enable both those starting out and those who have already succeeded with API integrations but are looking to do more. You will find both our reference library of API endpoints as well as our guides on carrying out some more routine tasks.

To give you an idea of what you can do with the PMM api you can:

- add database instances to monitor, be it MYSQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB
- check the availability of PMM updates
- update PMM and check if PMM is successfully updated or not
- change the configuration of the PMM server
- download PMM Server logs to troubleshoot an issue
- kick off a backup prior to a significant change
- spin up a new database to run tests after a code commit
