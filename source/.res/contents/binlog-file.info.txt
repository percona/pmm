There can be more binlog files depending on the rotation policy adopted (for
example using the configuration variables ``max_binlog_size`` and ``expire_logs_days``)
or even because of server reboots.

When planning the disk space, take care of the overall dimension of binlog files
and adopt a good rotation policy or think about having a separate mount point or
disk to store the binlog data.
