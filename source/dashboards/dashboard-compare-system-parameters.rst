The Nodes Compare dashboard allows you to compare wide range of
parameters of the servers monitored by PMM. Same type parameters are shown
side by side for all the servers, grouped into the following sections:

- System Information
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk Partitions
- Disk Performance
- Network

The *System Information* section shows the *System Info* summary of each
server, as well as *System Uptime*, *CPU Cores*, *RAM*, *Saturation Metrics*,
and *Load Average* gauges.

The *CPU* section offers the *CPU Usage*, *Interrupts*, and *Context Switches*
metrics.

In the *Memory* section, you can find the *Memory Usage*, *Swap Usage*, and
*Swap Activity* metrics.

The *Disk Partitions* section encapsulates two metrics, *Mountpoint Usage* and
*Free Space*.

The *Disk Performance* section contains the *I/O Activity*, *Disk Operations*,
*Disk Bandwidth*, *Disk IO Utilization*, *Disk Latency*, and *Disk Load*
metrics.

Finally, *Network* section shows *Network Traffic*, and *Network Utilization
Hourly* metrics.
