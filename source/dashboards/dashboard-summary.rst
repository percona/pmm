*********
CPU Usage
*********

The CPU Usage graph shows how much of the overall CPU time is used by the
server.  It has 4 components: system, user, iowait and softirq.

System
   The proportion of time the CPU spent inside the Linux kernel for operations
   like context switching, memory allocation and queue handling.
User
   The time spent in the user space.  Normally, most of the MySQL CPU time is
   in user space, a too high value may indicate an indexing issue.
Iowait
   The time the CPU spent waiting for disk IO requests to complete.  A high value
   of iowait indicates a disk bound load.
Softirq
   The portion of time the CPU spent servicing software interrupts generated by
   the device drivers.  A high value of *softirq* may indicates a poorly configured
   device.  The network is generally the main source of high softirq values.  Be
   aware the graph presents global values, while there may be a lot of unused CPU,
   a single core may be saturated.  Look for any quantity saturating at 100/(cpu
   core count).

.. _dashboard.system.processes:

*********
Processes
*********

The Processes metric shows how many processes/threads are either in the kernel
run queue (runnable state) or in the blocked queue (waiting for I/O).

When the number of process in the runnable state is constantly higher than the
number of CPU cores available, the load is CPU bound.

When the number of process blocked waiting for I/O is large, the load is disk bound.

The running average of the sum of these two quantities is the basis of the loadavg metric.

.. _dashboard.system.network-traffic:

***************
Network Traffic
***************

The Network Traffic graph shows the rate of data transferred over the network.
Outbound is the data sent by the server while Inbound is the data received by
the server.

Look for signs of saturation given the capacity of the network devices. If the
outbound rate is constantly high and close to saturation and you have plenty
of available CPU, you should consider activating the compression option on the
MySQL clients and slaves.

.. _dashboard.system.io-activity:

************
I/O Activity
************

The I/O Activity graph shows the rates of data read from (Page In) and written
to (Page Out) the all the disks as collected from the vmstat bi and bo columns.

.. _dashboard.system.disk-latency:

************
Disk Latency
************

The Disk Latency graph shows the average time to complete read an write
operations to the disks.

There is one data series per operation type (Read or Write) per disk mounted to
the server.

High latency values, typically more than 15 ms,  are an indication of a disk
bound workload saturating the storage subsystem or, a faulty/degraded hardware.

.. _dashboard.system.mysql-query:

*************
MySQL Queries
*************

The MySQL Queries graph shows the rate of queries processed by MySQL.  The rate
of queries is a rough indication of the MySQL Server load.

.. _dashboard.system.innodb-row-operation:

*********************
InnoDB Row Operations
*********************

The InnoDB Row Operations graph shows the rate of rows processed by InnoDB.  It
is a good indication of the MySQL Server load.  A high value of Rows read, which
can easily be above a million, is an indication of poor queries or deficient
indexing.

The amounts of rows inserted, updated and deleted help appreciate the server
write load.

.. _dashboard.system.top-mysql-command:

******************
Top MySQL Commands
******************

The Top MySQL Commands graph shows the rate of the various kind of SQL
statements executed on the MySQL Server.

.. _dashboard.system.top-mysql-handler:

******************
Top MySQL Handlers
******************

The Top MySQL Handlers graph shows the rate of the various low level storage
engine handler calls. The most important ones to watch are ``read_next`` and
``read_rnd_next``.

A high value for ``read_rnd_next`` is an indication there are table scans while a
high value of ``read_next`` is an indication of index scans.
